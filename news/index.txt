author: martoncnemeth

Hello everyone! Our first STMU and EGM of the year are here!

- When: Wednesday, 23rd October, 18:00-21:00
- Where: Informatics Forum, G.07

The night will start with a talk from [Shiu Ka Heng](https://shiukaheng.com/), a graduate from Edinburgh, who will talk "The Lost Metropolis: Immortalizing Hong Kong's Changing Landscapes in Virtual Reality". You will hear about Heng's project of digitally preserving Hong Kong's urban spaces threatened by redevelopment, and have a chance to explore his virtual 3D spaces with VR headsets!

Following the talk, we will have **3 elections** for the roles of Vice President, Junior Treasurer, and First Year Representative.

### Manifestos

Manifestos for the two positions are now live! [Click here to view them.](https://comp-soc.com/news/2024-10-10-oct-egm-manifestos/)  
Please read on to find out how to add your own, if you are interested.

### EGM

The positions we're electing are:

- **Vice-President**:

  - Organises monthly STMUs and other miscellaneous events with our sponsors.
  - Oversees working with our SIGs (Special Interest Groups).
  
- **Junior Treasurer**

  - Manage daily financial operations - including making reimbursements, maintaining budgets, and tracking transactions.
  - Gain hands-on experience in the financials of managing a £70,000+ balance sheet.
  - Obtain valuable insights into financial management and prepare for a potential future role as Treasurer.

- **1st Year Representative**

  - Responsible for communication between their year and the Society, and promotes events to their year.
  - Responsible for organising some of CompSoc's large projects and events, such as InfBall, HackTheBurgh or pwnedEd.
  - Gain an insight into the day-to-day of running CompSoc, and valuable experience in organising large scale society events.
  

If you are interested in applying for any of these positions, you need to:

1. **Write a manifesto** which will convince everyone to vote for you. It must be a **maximum of 200 words** and in PDF format. Submit them to committee@comp-soc.com with your full name and the position you're applying for in the subject (for example, Marton Nemeth, Vice-President). Include your name and position in the document (this does not count towards word count). The deadline to submit a manifesto is October 22nd at 18:00.

Although it is possible to run impromptu on the day, submitting a manifesto will typically give you much better chances to win.

2. You also need to prepare a speech. You will have strictly **1 minute** for your speech. You may get questions asked afterwards.

### Student Tech Meet-Up

[Shiu Ka Heng](https://shiukaheng.com/), a graduate from Edinburgh will take us through "The Lost Metropolis: Immortalizing Hong Kong's Changing Landscapes in Virtual Reality."  

Join us for a deep dive into how this interdisciplinary project is tackling the challenge of digitally preserving Hong Kong's urban spaces threatened by redevelopment. Discover the art and science behind large-scale 3D reconstruction, from robotics development for autonomous 3D capture to employing advanced techniques like Gaussian splatting. Heng will share insights into the project's journey, the hurdles overcome, and the latest in 3D reconstruction technology.

**You will also have the opportunity to glimpse into the project yourself through some VR headsets!**

Finally, we will, as always, have free pizza and drinks for you too.

CompSoc <3 You!

Hey everyone! Get ready for our fourth STMU (tech talks) of the year, happening **Wednesday, 28th February at 18:00** at the Informatics Forum, G.07.

This month, we have the privilege of hosting two remarkable speakers:

- **[Heng from ProjectShare](https://shiukaheng.com/)** will take us through "The Lost Metropolis: Immortalizing Hong Kong's Changing Landscapes in Virtual Reality." Join us for a deep dive into how this interdisciplinary project is tackling the challenge of digitally preserving Hong Kong's urban spaces threatened by redevelopment. Discover the art and science behind large-scale 3D reconstruction, from robotics development for autonomous 3D capture to employing advanced techniques like Gaussian splatting. Heng will share insights into the project's journey, the hurdles overcome, and the latest in 3D reconstruction technology.
- **[Dr. John Longley](https://www.castlesbook.org/)** will present on "Are all programming languages equally powerful?" We all know that programming languages come in different 'styles': imperative, functional, object-oriented and so on. But do languages also differ in more fundamental ways? Are there things we can perform in some languages that would be simply impossible in others? Or possible but much less efficient? The answers to these questions depends on how exactly we interpret them. Dr. John Longley will try to give an accessible overview of my own research in this area, pointing out some non-trivial differences among existing languages, and more specifically introducing an upcoming new language feature known as 'effect handlers'.

Enjoy some delicious pizza and drinks on us. We can't wait to see you all there!

As always, CompSoc <3 You!

Hey, everyone! First STMU of 2024 is here! On Wednesday, 31st of January at 18:00 to 21:00 we will have the election of two positions and two speakers. Venue: Informatics Forum G.07.

### Manifestos

Manifestos for the two positions are now live! [Click here to view them.](https://comp-soc.com/blog/2024/01/23/january-egm-manifestos.html)

Please read on to find out how to add your own, if you are interested.

### EGM

The positions we're electing are:

- **Treasurer:**

  - Accountable to the committee and members for the finances of the society
  - Reimburses society members for expenses
  - Writing annual financial report

- **Technical Secretary:**

  - Maintains technical services (website & Google suite)
  - In charge of technical setup for events
  - Experience with server management is recommended

If you are interested in applying for any of the two positions, you need to do two things:

You need to write a manifesto which will convince everyone to vote for you. It must be a maximum of 200 words and in PDF format. Submit them to committee@comp-soc.com with your full name and the position you're applying for in the subject (for example, John Doe, Treasurer). Also include this information in the PDF (this will not count to your word count). The deadline to submit a manifesto is 24 hours before the STMU, so the 30th at 18:00.

Although it is possible to run impromptu on the day, submitting a manifesto will typically give you much better chances to win.

You also need to prepare a speech. Technical secretary has **1 minute** for the speech, treausrer has **3 minutes**. You may get questions asked afterwards.

### STMU

This time we have two speakers! Each will be 40 to 60 minutes long.

- [Liam O'Connor](http://liamoc.net/), **Why domain theory matters**. In this talk O'Connor will give a "whirlwind tour of denotational semantics, an oft-neglected but very important branch of theoretical computer science, which truly connects computer programs to mathematics.""
- [Matt Henderson](https://twitter.com/matthen2), **Animating Mathematically**. Matt Henderson has worked as a researcher in conversational language understanding at Google, Apple, PolyAI, and Reka. But in his spare time he creates mathematical animations, explaining concepts like chaos theory with bouncing balls, breadth first search with lightning strike simulations, and cellular automata with Pokémon battles. In this talk, Henderson will dive into a few of his animations, and the code used to generate them.

Finally, we will, as always, have pizza and drinks for you too.

### Amendments to the Constitution

We will be voting on an constitutional amendment, which is on our GitHub, see:

- [Change the EDI rep to an elected position](https://github.com/compsoc-edinburgh/constitution/pull/41/)

Hello everyone! Our first STMU of the year and our EGM are here! On Wednesday 25th October at 18:00 to 21:00 we will have the election of two positions and two speakers. As usual, this will be in the Informatics Forum G.07 (the big room on your left as you enter the building).

### Manifestos

Manifestos for the two positions are now live! [Click here to view them.](https://comp-soc.com/blog/2023/10/18/egm-2023-manifestos.html)

Please read on to find out how to add your own, if you are interested.

### EGM

The positions we're electing are:

- 1st year representative,
- and old person representative (for 5th year (integrated Masters) and postgrad students and non-students).

These people will be responsible for representing their year on the committee, promoting the CompSoc events to their year, and will be responsible for any projects they decide to take up which they believe their year would enjoy. As well as that, they get to help out with any tasks which have been dropped, since we all lead busy lives.

If you are interested in applying for any of the two positions, you need to do two things:

You need to write a manifesto which will convince everyone to vote for you. It must be a maximum of 200 words and in PDF format. Submit them to committee@comp-soc.com with your full name and the position you're applying for in the subject (for example, Charlotte Ausel, Social Secretary). Also include this information in the PDF (this will not count to your word count). The deadline to submit a manifesto is 24 hours before the STMU, so the 24th at 18:00.

Although it is possible to run impromptu on the day, submitting a manifesto will typically give you much better chances to win.

You also need to prepare a speech. You will have strictly 1 minute for your speech (typically, executive positions have 2 minutes, but these are not up for election this time). You may get questions asked afterwards.

### STMU

This time we have two speakers! Each will be 40 to 60 minutes long.

- Philip Wadler, Unlocking Brilliance. Hamming's Insights on Research meets Strunk and White's Wisdom on Writing
- James K., Delving Into the Absurd. Exploring esolangs and the art of impractical programming.

Finally, we will, as always, have pizza and drinks for you too.

### Amendments to the Constitution

We will be voting on an constitutional amendment, which is on our GitHub, see:

    > During my time as Secretary I spent around 2-3 hours a week writing minutes, working with the VP to help out with SIGs (namely SIGINT), replying to some emails or informing the committee about certain emails. Making PRs to the CompSoc github to publicise our notes and basic admin work of the society, mostly the discord.

- **Treasurer**:
  - Accountable to the committee and members for the finances of the society
  - Reimburses society members for expenses
  - Writing annual financial report
    > Treasurer is a role in which you are responsible for the financial aspects of CompSoc, including providing reimbursements, setting budgets and producing financial reports. You are expected to communicate with subcommittees and sigs in order to make sure everyone understands their financial responsibilities and allowances. This role takes about 2-3 hours per week usually, but can take a up to 5 hours around events such as HTB and InfBall. For this role, you need to be able to make well thought out decisions and communicate well.

- **2nd year, 3rd year, Final year, Postgraduate and Old Person representatives**
  - Responsible for communication between their years and the Society, and promotes events to their year.
  - Year reps are also responsible for any projects they take up throughout the year.
  - (Note that 1st year rep is elected at our EGM in October.)
    > As a year representative, my job is to voice the opinions of the second years at committee meetings. This includes things like suggesting times which line up with informatics coursework, and giving feedback as to how appealing things are to people in my year. Plus, whenever there's an issue which needs to be dealt with and people are already busy, I'd be happy to help with it too.

- **Technical Secretary**:
  - Maintains technical services and in charge of technical setup for events.
  - Experience with server management is recommended.
    > Most weeks I spend a couple of hours with this role (mainly with meetings, setting up emails/site config for SIGs, and helping at events), but there are a few spikes through out the year where the workload increases to over 10 hours a week (usually when preparing for events like InfBall, welcome week, etc). The core part of the job involves working with Linux and Docker, and some basic web development (both front and back end). A couple of the things I did this year was convert our DigitalOcean server over to a new provider, migrate our services over to Nix and set up an internal wiki and link shortener service! There's lots to do, and it's a great opportunity to learn new technologies.

- **Social Secretary**:
  - Plans and organises our social events i.e. our pub nights, bowling, etc.
  - In charge of social media accounts!
    > In average, I spend about 1-2 hours each week planning the events. This includes emailing the venues, or going in person to the places to pay deposits or picking up items for the events. It also includes posting on social media about events and generally promoting the events. You might have an increase of work around freshers but apart from that the amount of hours is usually consistent.

- **Graphic Designer**:
  - Responsible for the creation of art, logos, and other designs required by the society for events, merchandise, and other promotional material.
    > The role requires designing at least one design per week, and may involve additional design work for SIGs. The freshers week requires a bit more commitment such as designing flyers.

### Constitutional Amendments

We have one amendment that we'll be voting on:

1. https://github.com/compsoc-edinburgh/constitution/pull/36

- LawTech have asked to secede from CompSoc as a SIG, so a vote is needed to remove them from the constitution. Voting for/against this does NOT constitute a vote for LawTech remaining/leaving CompSoc, only for updating our constitution.

On Tuesday at 18:00, we'll have this year's Annual General Meeting, as well as our Student Tech Meetup. Here are the session details, and the election manifestos.

**Venue:** TechCube Zero, or Online (on YouTube). No tickets required!
**Time:** 18:00 - est. 20:30 BST
**Food:** Free fancy Civerinos pizza

**Programme:**

**Dietmar Kuhl, Senior Engineer at Bloomberg** - Quicker Sorting

> Quicksort is a well-known sorting algorithm used to implement sort functionality in many libraries, but a textbook implementation of the algorithm is actually not that quick. Some small additions can improve the implementation significantly. This presentation starts with a simple implementation and makes incremental improvements to eventually yield a proper generic and fast sorting function. All code will be in C++ but it should be possible to follow the majority of the reasoning with knowledge of another programming language.

**CompSoc** - Committee Elections and Votes on Constitutional Amendments

> We're holding an election to elect a new committee. Candidates will give 1-minute speeches (2 minutes for President, Secretary, and Treasurer), and the audience may ask questions. We'll also vote on some constitutional amendments. See below for details.

## Election Details

If you want to vote in the EGM, you need to [make sure you have CompSoc membership](/join).

We also allow people to run on the night, if you did not have time to create manifestos.

### Original post below

In the second half of our next STMU (<time datetime="2022-03-29 18:00Z">18:00, 29th of March</time>), we will be holding our <abbr title="Annual General Meeting">AGM</abbr> where we vote for our new committee and any constitutional amendments.

The positions available are: President, Vice-President, Secretary, Treasurer, Technical Secretary, Social Secretary, Graphics Designer, 2nd Year Representative, 3rd Year Representative, 4th Year Representative, Postgraduate & Old Person Representative.

See the following for descriptions of each position.

  - Willing to dedicate a lot of time.
- **Vice-President**:
  - Organises monthly STMUs and other miscellaneous events with our sponsors.
  - Oversees working with our SIGs (Special Interest Groups).
    > VP takes up about 4-5 hours most weeks, more depending on how much is going on. As well as organising STMUs, you're also expected to help out with other events that are going on, like programming competitions or smaller meetups. You'll need to take lots of initiatives, but this role can help you develop very useful transferrable skills like communication and time management!

- **Secretary**:
  - Responsible for the administration of the society
  - Publicising events by newsletters, social media etc

  - Society merch
    > I spent around 5-6 hours per week, scattered across the week - not including time attending CompSoc events, which on average should add another 2 (but they're great fun!) My main responsibilities are the admin work of a society: promoting society events, replying to emails and messages, keeping minutes, as well as keeping track of the committee overall. Some basic GitHub knowledge comes in handy, as we make pull requests on our website. It would also be ideal if you can handle both Facebook and Instagram pages.

- **Treasurer**:

  - Maintains technical services and in charge of technical setup for events.
  - Experience with server management is recommended.
    > I spent around 1-2 hours per week off-peak and 7-8 per week during rare peaks (event-related preparation). Some stuff I did this year was building websites for CompSoc cookbook and InfBall, and migrating BetterInformatics from Tardis to DigitalOcean! Lots of experience/fun, guaranteed. In other years, TechSecs have made Discord bots, HTB registration portals, etc. Some minimum required skills are basic unix/SSH, Git, experience with webservers, and basic front- and back-end web development, but you can always ask questions to past TechSecs if you don't know so don't worry :)

- **Social Secretary**:
  - Plans and organises our social events i.e. our pub nights, bowling, etc.
  - In charge of social media accounts!
    > In average, I spend about 1-2 hours each week planning the events. This includes emailing the venues, or going in person to the places to pay deposits or picking up items for the events. It also includes posting on social media about events and generally promoting the events. You might have an increase of work around freshers but apart from that the amount of hours is usually consistent.

            <quote style="font-style: italic; display: block; padding-left: 2rem">
                This talk will focus on the benefits of marrying processes with data, particularly in the context of socio-technical systems, including the so-called "social machines". I will present our progress on this front through a decade of research on logic-based workflow modelling and management. In this, we use formal methods to construct process models with associated "correct-by-construction" guarantees. The models are then deployed to be executed, combined with data sources, such as IoT sensors, and to provide useful analytics and insights. I will showcase applications in healthcare and manufacturing, effectively covering the full spectrum from rich theory to real-world practice.

This also raises some fundamental questions: while the robots are ready to share control, what is the optimal trade-off between autonomy and automation that we are comfortable with?

## Event Details

On Friday (today) at 18:30 we have this year's first monthly Student Tech Meetup as well as our Emergency General Meeting to elect some new committee members! Here are the session details, and the election manifestos.

- **Venue:** Online (on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/compsocedinburgh) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOEMTnIKR29AnSVVdLQZg3Q)). No tickets required!
- **Time:** 18:30 - est. 20:30 BST

### Programme

**Dylan Thinnes** - Why We Learn Languages

> Our programming languages are Turing-complete, meaning they all can solve the same problems - so why do we bother to learn more than one?  
> In this talk, we'll go over how programming languages shape (for better or worse) the way we think about problems.  
> We'll go over languages you have heard of, some that are more obscure, and even some "joke" languages, and see what they all bring to the table.

**CompSoc Committee** - Election

> We're holding an election to elect a new Vice President, 1st Year Representative, and 3rd Year Representative.  
> Candidates will give 1 minute speeches (2 minutes for VP), and the audience may be ask questions.  
> See below for details.

title: 'G-Research Event!'
author: Lars

On the 4th of October, CompSoc hosted an exciting coding challenge in partnership with G-Research. Over 90 members participated in the two-hour competition that was focused on natural language processing.

The event kicked off with talks given by G-Research employees outlining what the company does and what it is like to work there. The participants were grouped into teams of four and were provided merchandise before the challenge began. Shortly after, the competition started, with every team eager to solve as many problems as possible.

The problems were diverse and had varying degrees of difficulty. From creating operations with Latin numerals to converting measurements, there was a challenge for everyone. The participants were encouraged to only use standard library functions, which meant that they had to build their NLP model from scratch – an additional challenge posed to the teams.

After two hours of hard work in problem-solving, the competition was over and the winners were awarded their prizes!

One of our committee members said “Despite it being my first coding challenge, I felt I really contributed to the team and solved a couple of problems myself! This sparked my interest in programming competitions as a whole and helped me improve important skills that I’ll carry forward in university and beyond.”

We would like to thank our sponsor, G-Research for the lovely merchandise and for helping us host the event!

<img src="https://compsoc-edinburgh.github.io/uploads/2018-12-01-LHD/everyone.jpeg" alt="Local Hack Day 2018" class="img-fluid">
On the first day of December, CompSoc hosted the annual Local Hack Day.

Despite the imminent exams breathing down their necks, over 20 passionate hackers dedicated their day to come into AT and create something exciting and new.

The team **“It’s Easy!”** tackled the website redesign challenge, adding a little twist – using the provided Azure credits, they implemented facial recognition for members of their concept site! They make it look so… well, easy!

<img src="https://compsoc-edinburgh.github.io/uploads/2018-12-01-LHD/itsEasyTeam.jpg" alt="Team It's Easy" class="img-fluid">

Team **"Wuwin"** took their shot at reinventing the wheel. Just not the one you're thinking of... To be more precise, a ring... They're bringing the classic drinking game Ring of Fire to the web!

<img src="https://compsoc-edinburgh.github.io/uploads/2018-12-01-LHD/wuwinTeam.jpg" alt="Team Wuwin" class="img-fluid">

Team **"v.0.5"** were building a game involving helicopters, paratroopers, and whatnot.

<img src="https://compsoc-edinburgh.github.io/uploads/2018-12-01-LHD/v05Team.jpg" alt="v0.0.5 Team" class="img-fluid">

**Cody** worked on _Monad for the digital era_ (Not the same Monads you learnt about in Functional Programming)! It's essentially some sort of card game... And yes, that mouse is from a while ago.

<img src="https://compsoc-edinburgh.github.io/uploads/2018-12-01-LHD/cody.jpg" alt="Cody" class="img-fluid">

**Dylan** has taken up the Sisyphean task of developing a game with Haskell and ncurses. Press F to pay respects.

<img src="https://compsoc-edinburgh.github.io/uploads/2018-12-01-LHD/dylan.jpg" alt="Dylan" class="img-fluid">

Team **"ChachaVidhayak"** developed AlcoMender, which picks an alcoholic beverage for you based on your mood that it detects through a picture! An interesting use of Machine Learning!

<img src="https://compsoc-edinburgh.github.io/uploads/2018-12-01-LHD/teamChachaVidhayak.jpg" alt="Team ChachaVidhayak" class="img-fluid">

Finally, after going through countless bags of crisps, litres of Irn Bru and a dozen pizzas, the winners of our Local Hack Day challenges emerged:

### Best Overall Hack

At [last night's EGM](https://www.facebook.com/events/2191698291111220/) we had to elect [some new committee members](https://comp-soc.com/blog/2018/10/05/october-egm.html)!

Our new office bearers are:

- Secretary: Mo Javad
- Technical Secretary: Patrick Kage
- Social Secretary: Tony Duggan
- 1st Year Rep: Kyle Cotton

As requested by one of the candidates, here are the breakdowns of votes for each position:

- Secretary
  - Total votes: 63
  - Bora Mert Alper: 14
  - Mo Javad: 49
- Technical Secretary
  - Total votes: 61
  - Ege Elgun: 13
  - Patrick Kage: 42
  - Samuel Macleod: 6
- Social Secretary:
  - Total votes: 55
  - Ron: 7
  - Azam Khan: 18
  - Raman Goyal: 9
  - Tony Duggan: 21
- 1st Year Rep:
  - Total Votes: 47
  - Ron: 4
  - Kyle Cotton: 21
  - Jack Watt: 4
  - Lorenzo Baldini: 18

For all of the votes Ron was an option (reopen nominations), however he sadly did not win any positions and didn't even get any votes for Secretary or Tech Sec. There were 2 bad votes, one for social secretary where the number was unrecognisable and another where it was unclear which position the slip was for.

We would ordinarily just be electing a first year rep. and any positions that weren't filled in our March AGM, however due to some resignations we are also reelecting our Secretary, TechSec, and SocialSec. Once you've looked over our [positions guidelines](/elections) take a look at the manifestos of who's standing below!

Want to stand for something but haven't submitted a manifesto? Not to fear! You can send a manifesto to our [Vice President](mailto:vicepresident@comp-soc.com) up until 3pm on Wednesday the 16th of October and we'll post it here as soon as we get it!

See you all on Wednesday, and remember, CompSoc ❤️ You!

Here's who's running for election at our October EGM.
More information about the EGM can be found [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-10-04-egm %}).

#### Dylan Oshima — running for 1st year rep

<blockquote class="blockquote" style="font-size: initial">
<p>
I have three objectives by becoming the year one rep:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Get closer to my fellow classmates and learn more about everyone.</li>
<li>Support my fellow classmates by: providing resources for school and research, helping to organize cool activities, providing prep for job interviews, and being friendly to whoever needs or wants help.</li>
<li>Provide top notch pizza for everyone.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

#### Ege Elgun — running for 1st year rep

<blockquote class="blockquote" style="font-size: initial">
<p>Champions of CompSoc</p>

<p>“To those who can hear me I say: do not despair! The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed.” We will reach to the promised land, with unlimited supply of free pizzas and coffee, eventually. I’m willing to sacrifice my precious WoW hours (which worths £0.014 per hour. Gosh darnit Blizzard.) for our common cause.</p>

<p>Previously, I have devoted myself to organize 3 different Model United Nations conferences as a member of academic, and sponsorship teams. Moreover, I have founded the one and only programming club in my high school. During those distant times I would organize competitions, and arrange field trips to local tech companies while teaching newbs some Hax0r skillz.</p>

<p>As a community, I believe that I am adept to the culture of CompSoc enough for me to reflect and enhance the experience.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Ege Elgun.</p>

<p>This message is brought to you by electrons (representing 1s and 0s)...</p>
</blockquote>
#### Elspeth Smith — running for 1st year rep

<blockquote class="blockquote" style="font-size: initial">
<p>I feel I would be suitable for the role of first year class rep due to a number of reasons. First of all I am enthusiastic about tech and computer science and am already actively involved with comp soc through cascaders evenings. In addition I am approachable and friendly and all set to get started in the role.</p>

<p>As 1st year rep I would be active in pursuing issues which matter to inf1 students (such a a microwave for AT4 or lobbying to increase the use of the word set in computation and logic lectures) and of course taking the concerns of students into account to improve our 1st year experience and comp soc as a whole.</p>

Some applied for the other year rep roles, but did not provide a manifesto.

Best of luck to everyone!

title: The October EGM

Our first STMU (student tech meetup) is also an EGM (extraordinary general meeting), and it is in two weeks time: 18th October.

We'll be electing the freshers rep (first year), the 3rd year rep, and the final year rep (4th/5th year).

The year rep is responsible for communicating to and promoting the society to students in their year.

This means: shoutouts in lectures, outreach both in and outside Informatics, and coordinating coursework nights (with pizza).

If you are interested in running for election, please send [secretary@comp-soc.com](mailto:secretary@comp-soc.com) an email with your student number and a manifesto (a few sentences about why you are suitable for the role).

Here's how this election will be run:

- Votes are cast by the raising of hands, unless any member requests otherwise, in which case votes are cast by secret ballot.
- **You must be a paying member to run for election, or to vote at the EGM.**
- There will be an option to re-open nominations, presented as an additional candidate, “Ron”.
- Members running for election have up to 2 minutes to present their speech.

Please submit your manifesto as we'll be publishing these on the 16th of October, and it'll increase your chance of being elected. You may also run for election at the EGM even if you do not email us, so the aforementioned deadline is not a hard deadline.

We'll also be voting on some constitutional changes, you can find these changes [here](https://github.com/compsoc-edinburgh/constitution/milestone/1).

CompSoc <3s You!

title: The new website
author: qaisjp

Here at CompSoc we have the tradition of writing a brand new website almost
every year, and this year is no different.

From MediaWiki, to WordPress, to
[Django](https://github.com/compsoc-edinburgh/website-django), and to Jekyll.
This is not the first time using Jekyll,
[last year's project](https://github.com/compsoc-edinburgh/website2016) made
use of the nice Minimal Mistakes template. This year, however, we've rewritten
the whole thing from ground up, with the support of SIG: Web (and Bootstrap!)

We still have a couple ideas in the works, and we are always looking for your opinions
and suggestions, so please do
[share them](https://github.com/compsoc-edinburgh/website2017/issues/new). You will
need a GitHub account to do this, so if you don't have one, definitely go ahead and
create one. Feel free to make a post on [our Facebook group](/community) if that works for you.
