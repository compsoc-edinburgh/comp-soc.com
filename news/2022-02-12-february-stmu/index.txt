            &#x3C;quote style="font-style: italic; display: block; padding-left: 2rem">
                This talk will focus on the benefits of marrying processes with data, particularly in the context of socio-technical systems, including the so-called "social machines". I will present our progress on this front through a decade of research on logic-based workflow modelling and management. In this, we use formal methods to construct process models with associated "correct-by-construction" guarantees. The models are then deployed to be executed, combined with data sources, such as IoT sensors, and to provide useful analytics and insights. I will showcase applications in healthcare and manufacturing, effectively covering the full spectrum from rich theory to real-world practice.

            &#x3C;quote style="font-style: italic; display: block; padding-left: 2rem">
                This talk will briefly introduce powerful machine learning technologies ranging from robust multi-modal sensing, shared representations, scalable real-time learning and adaptation and compliant actuation that are enabling us to reap the benefits of increased autonomy while still feeling securely in control. This also raises some fundamental questions: while the robots are ready to share control, what is the optimal trade-off between autonomy and automation that we are comfortable with?
