<li>Writing minutes &#x26; preparing agendas for AGM, EGM, and weekly meetings
<blockquote>
<p>"I spent around 5-6 hours per week, scattered across the week - not including time attending CompSoc events, which on average should add another 2 (but theyâ€™re great fun!) My main responsibilities are the admin work of a society: promoting society events, replying to emails and messages, keeping minutes, as well as keeping track of the committee overall. Some basic GitHub knowledge comes in handy, as we make pull requests on our website."</p>
