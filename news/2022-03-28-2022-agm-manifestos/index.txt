c:T158d,<p>On Tuesday at 18:00, we'll have this year's Annual General Meeting, as well as our Student Tech Meetup. Here are the session details, and the election manifestos.</p>
<p><strong>Venue:</strong> TechCube Zero, or Online (on YouTube). No tickets required!
<strong>Time:</strong> 18:00 - est. 20:30 BST
<strong>Food:</strong> Free fancy Civerinos pizza</p>
<p><strong>Programme:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dietmar Kuhl, Senior Engineer at Bloomberg</strong> - Quicker Sorting</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quicksort is a well-known sorting algorithm used to implement sort functionality in many libraries, but a textbook implementation of the algorithm is actually not that quick. Some small additions can improve the implementation significantly. This presentation starts with a simple implementation and makes incremental improvements to eventually yield a proper generic and fast sorting function. All code will be in C++ but it should be possible to follow the majority of the reasoning with knowledge of another programming language.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CompSoc</strong> - Committee Elections and Votes on Constitutional Amendments</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're holding an election to elect a new committee. Candidates will give 1-minute speeches (2 minutes for President, Secretary, and Treasurer), and the audience may ask questions. We'll also vote on some constitutional amendments. See below for details.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Election Details</h2>
<p>If you want to vote in the EGM, you need to <a href="/join">make sure you have CompSoc membership</a>.</p>
<p>We also allow people to run on the night, if you did not have time to create manifestos.</p>
