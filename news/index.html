But do languages also differ in more fundamental ways? Are there things we can perform in some languages that would be simply impossible in others? Or possible but much less efficient? The answers to these questions depends on how exactly we interpret them. Dr. John Longley will try to give an accessible overview of my own research in this area, pointing out some non-trivial differences among existing languages, and more specifically introducing an upcoming new language feature known as 'effect handlers'.\n\nEnjoy some delicious pizza and drinks on us.

First STMU of 2024 is here! On Wednesday, 31st of January at 18:00 to 21:00 we will have the election of two positions and two speakers. Venue: Informatics Forum G.07.\n\n### Manifestos\n\nManifestos for the two positions are now live! [Click here to view them.](https://comp-soc.com/blog/2024/01/23/january-egm-manifestos.html)\n\nPlease read on to find out how to add your own, if you are interested.\n\n### EGM\n\nThe positions we're electing are:\n\n- **Treasurer:**\n\n  - Accountable to the committee and members for the finances of the society\n  - Reimburses society members for expenses\n  - Writing annual financial report\n\n- **Technical Secretary:**\n\n  - Maintains technical services (website \u0026 Google suite)\n  - In charge of technical setup for events\n  - Experience with server management is recommended\n\nIf you are interested in applying for any of the two positions, you need to do two things:\n\nYou need to write a manifesto which will convince everyone to vote for you. It must be a maximum of 200 words and in PDF format. Submit them to committee@comp-soc.com with your full name and the position you're applying for in the subject (for example, John Doe, Treasurer). Also include this information in the PDF (this will not count to your word count). The deadline to submit a manifesto is 24 hours before the STMU, so the 30th at 18:00.\n\nAlthough it is possible to run impromptu on the day, submitting a manifesto will typically give you much better chances to win.\n\nYou also need to prepare a speech. Technical secretary has **1 minute** for the speech, treausrer has **3 minutes**. You may get questions asked afterwards.\n\n### STMU\n\nThis time we have two speakers! Each will be 40 to 60 minutes long.\n\n- [Liam O'Connor](http://liamoc.net/), **Why domain theory matters**. In this talk O'Connor will give a \"whirlwind tour of denotational semantics, an oft-neglected but very important branch of theoretical computer science, which truly connects computer programs to mathematics.\"\"\n- [Matt Henderson](https://twitter.com/matthen2), **Animating Mathematically**. Matt Henderson has worked as a researcher in conversational language understanding at Google, Apple, PolyAI, and Reka. But in his spare time he creates mathematical animations, explaining concepts like chaos theory with bouncing balls, breadth first search with lightning strike simulations, and cellular automata with Pokémon battles.

Our first STMU of the year and our EGM are here! On Wednesday 25th October at 18:00 to 21:00 we will have the election of two positions and two speakers. As usual, this will be in the Informatics Forum G.07 (the big room on your left as you enter the building).\n\n### Manifestos\n\nManifestos for the two positions are now live! [Click here to view them.](https://comp-soc.com/blog/2023/10/18/egm-2023-manifestos.html)\n\nPlease read on to find out how to add your own, if you are interested.\n\n### EGM\n\nThe positions we're electing are:\n\n- 1st year representative,\n- and old person representative (for 5th year (integrated Masters) and postgrad students and non-students).\n\nThese people will be responsible for representing their year on the committee, promoting the CompSoc events to their year, and will be responsible for any projects they decide to take up which they believe their year would enjoy. As well as that, they get to help out with any tasks which have been dropped, since we all lead busy lives.\n\nIf you are interested in applying for any of the two positions, you need to do two things:\n\nYou need to write a manifesto which will convince everyone to vote for you. It must be a maximum of 200 words and in PDF format. Submit them to committee@comp-soc.com with your full name and the position you're applying for in the subject (for example, Charlotte Ausel, Social Secretary). Also include this information in the PDF (this will not count to your word count). The deadline to submit a manifesto is 24 hours before the STMU, so the 24th at 18:00.\n\nAlthough it is possible to run impromptu on the day, submitting a manifesto will typically give you much better chances to win.\n\nYou also need to prepare a speech. You will have strictly 1 minute for your speech (typically, executive positions have 2 minutes, but these are not up for election this time). You may get questions asked afterwards.\n\n### STMU\n\nThis time we have two speakers! Each will be 40 to 60 minutes long.\n\n- Philip Wadler, Unlocking Brilliance. Hamming's Insights on Research meets Strunk and White's Wisdom on Writing\n- James K., Delving Into the Absurd. Exploring esolangs and the art of impractical programming.\n\nFinally, we will, as always, have pizza and drinks for you too.\n\n### Amendments to the Constitution\n\nWe will be voting on an constitutional amendment, which is on our GitHub, see:\n\n- [Update the SIG member minimum to 10](https://github.com/compsoc-edinburgh/constitution/pull/40)\n\nCompSoc \u003c3 You!\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"1c:T1640,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"---\ntitle: 'Manifestos for 2023 March AGM'\nauthor: greg\nexcerpt_separator: '\u003c!--See More--\u003e'\nroles:\n  - title: President\n    people:\n      - name: Fergus White\n        url: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IWNYQdDBggwOTgri2wZgR-FpPENwqrwz/view?usp=share_link\n      - name: Japjot Singh\n  - title: Vice-President\n    people:\n      - name: Ali Abdelaal\n        url: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A1CTIjXVG_2D7VHvER7tVU5ZP9B-4Ofh/view?usp=sharing\n  - title: Secretary\n    people:\n      - name: Maya Copeland\n        url: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lZcMIWqEIyhMVzVrudLpwE0kyYfmU-RX/view?usp=share_link\n  - title: Treasurer\n    people:\n      - name: Sophie Bata-Madden\n  - title: Graphic Designer\n    people:\n      - name: Katarzyna (Kasia) Zawistowska\n        url: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gGJ6ltq6PBIeIkVrYBoCiE2Ap3TA_TP9/view?usp=sharing\n      - name: Yuto Takano\n        url: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MyoZTR1t_IuM3rG9VsLDaTcyVhuPuD0j/view?usp=share_link\n  - title: TechSec\n    people:\n      - name: Nobody has run for this position.

As well as running weekly meetings to discuss current agenda points, you’re also expected to help out with other events that are going on, like STMUs or smaller meetups. You will need to take initiative in communicating with other society's around the school and sponsors, but this role can help you develop very useful transferrable skills like communication and time management!\n    \u003e\n    \u003e \u003cfooter\u003e\n    \u003e  — Ben, current President\n    \u003e \u003c/footer\u003e\n\n- **Vice-President**:\n  - Organises monthly STMUs and other miscellaneous events with our sponsors.\n  - Oversees working with our SIGs (Special Interest Groups).\n    \u003e Typically, you'll spend around 4-5 hours each week on this role, though it may vary depending on how busy things are. In addition to organizing STMUs, you'll also have the opportunity to get involved with the SIGs and their events. This can be a great chance to develop some valuable soft skills like teamwork, communication, and leadership.\n    \u003e\n    \u003e \u003cfooter\u003e\n    \u003e  — Krzysztof, current VP\n    \u003e \u003c/footer\u003e\n- **Secretary**:\n  - Responsible for the administration of the society\n  - Publicising events by newsletters, social media etc\n  - Writing minutes \u0026 preparing agendas for AGM, EGM, and weekly meetings\n  - Society merch\n    \u003e During my time as Secretary I spent around 2-3 hours a week writing minutes, working with the VP to help out with SIGs (namely SIGINT), replying to some emails or informing the committee about certain emails. Making PRs to the CompSoc github to publicise our notes and basic admin work of the society, mostly the discord.\n    \u003e\n    \u003e \u003cfooter\u003e\n    \u003e  — Maya, current Secretary\n    \u003e \u003c/footer\u003e\n- **Treasurer**:\n  - Accountable to the committee and members for the finances of the society\n  - Reimburses society members for expenses\n  - Writing annual financial report\n    \u003e Treasurer is a role in which you are responsible for the financial aspects of CompSoc, including providing reimbursements, setting budgets and producing financial reports. You are expected to communicate with subcommittees and sigs in order to make sure everyone understands their financial responsibilities and allowances. This role takes about 2-3 hours per week usually, but can take a up to 5 hours around events such as HTB and InfBall. For this role, you need to be able to make well thought out decisions and communicate well.\n    \u003e\n    \u003e \u003cfooter\u003e\n    \u003e  — Sophie, current Treasurer\n    \u003e \u003c/footer\u003e\n- **2nd year, 3rd year, Final year, Postgraduate and Old Person representatives**\n  - Responsible for communication between their years and the Society, and promotes events to their year.\n  - Year reps are also responsible for any projects they take up throughout the year.\n  - (Note that 1st year rep is elected at our EGM in October.)\n    \u003e As a year representative, my job is to voice the opinions of the second years at committee meetings. This includes things like suggesting times which line up with informatics coursework, and giving feedback as to how appealing things are to people in my year. Plus, whenever there's an issue which needs to be dealt with and people are already busy, I'd be happy to help with it too.\n    \u003e\n    \u003e \u003cfooter\u003e\n    \u003e  — Charlotte, current 2nd year rep\n    \u003e \u003c/footer\u003e\n- **Technical Secretary**:\n  - Maintains technical services and in charge of technical setup for events.\n  - Experience with server management is recommended.\n    \u003e Most weeks I spend a couple of hours with this role (mainly with meetings, setting up emails/site config for SIGs, and helping at events), but there are a few spikes through out the year where the workload increases to over 10 hours a week (usually when preparing for events like InfBall, welcome week, etc). The core part of the job involves working with Linux and Docker, and some basic web development (both front and back end). A couple of the things I did this year was convert our DigitalOcean server over to a new provider, migrate our services over to Nix and set up an internal wiki and link shortener service! There's lots to do, and it's a great opportunity to learn new technologies.\n    \u003e\n    \u003e \u003cfooter\u003e\n    \u003e  — greg, current Tech Sec\n    \u003e \u003c/footer\u003e\n- **Social Secretary**:\n  - Plans and organises our social events i.e. our pub nights, bowling, etc.\n  - In charge of social media accounts!\n    \u003e In average, I spend about 1-2 hours each week planning the events. This includes emailing the venues, or going in person to the places to pay deposits or picking up items for the events. It also includes posting on social media about events and generally promoting the events. You might have an increase of work around freshers but apart from that the amount of hours is usually consistent.\n    \u003e\n    \u003e \u003cfooter\u003e\n    \u003e  — Amy, current Social Sec\n    \u003e \u003c/footer\u003e\n- **Graphic Designer**:\n  - Responsible for the creation of art, logos, and other designs required by the society for events, merchandise, and other promotional material.\n    \u003e The role requires designing at least one design per week, and may involve additional design work for SIGs. The freshers week requires a bit more commitment such as designing flyers.\n    \u003e\n    \u003e \u003cfooter\u003e\n    \u003e — Margo, current Graphic Designer\n    \u003e \u003c/footer\u003e\n\n### Want to run for a position?\n\n- Send committee@comp-soc.com your manifesto (PDF of max 200 words) **by Monday, 3rd April 2023** specifying your full name and the role in the title.\n- Prepare a speech. Length is 2 minutes for executive roles (President, VP, Secretary, Treasurer) and 1 minute for the other roles. You may get asked questions afterwards.\n\n### Constitutional Amendments\n\nWe have one amendment that we'll be voting on:\n\n1. https://github.com/compsoc-edinburgh/constitution/pull/36\n\n- LawTech have asked to secede from CompSoc as a SIG, so a vote is needed to remove them from the constitution.

Some small additions can improve the implementation significantly. This presentation starts with a simple implementation and makes incremental improvements to eventually yield a proper generic and fast sorting function.

The models are then deployed to be executed, combined with data sources, such as IoT sensors, and to provide useful analytics and insights.

Over 90 members participated in the two-hour competition that was focused on natural language processing.\n\nThe event kicked off with talks given by G-Research employees outlining what the company does and what it is like to work there. The participants were grouped into teams of four and were provided merchandise before the challenge began. Shortly after, the competition started, with every team eager to solve as many problems as possible.\n\nThe problems were diverse and had varying degrees of difficulty. From creating operations with Latin numerals to converting measurements, there was a challenge for everyone. The participants were encouraged to only use standard library functions, which meant that they had to build their NLP model from scratch – an additional challenge posed to the teams.\n\nAfter two hours of hard work in problem-solving, the competition was over and the winners were awarded their prizes!\n\nOne of our committee members said “Despite it being my first coding challenge, I felt I really contributed to the team and solved a couple of problems myself! This sparked my interest in programming competitions as a whole and helped me improve important skills that I’ll carry forward in university and beyond.”\n\nWe would like to thank our sponsor, G-Research for the lovely merchandise and for helping us host the event!\n2e:T8ae,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"---\ntitle: 'EGM 2019'\nauthor: Dee Yeum\n---\n\nCompSoc will be electing new positions in the next [EGM](https://www.facebook.com/events/396779284353051/) (6PM 16th October 2019 at AT LT1).
