c:Tf4b,<p>Hello everyone! Our first STMU and EGM of the year are here!</p>
<ul>
<li>When: Wednesday, 23rd October, 18:00-21:00</li>
<li>Where: Informatics Forum, G.07</li>
</ul>
<p>The night will start with a talk from <a href="https://shiukaheng.com/">Shiu Ka Heng</a>, a graduate from Edinburgh, who will talk "The Lost Metropolis: Immortalizing Hong Kong's Changing Landscapes in Virtual Reality". You will hear about Heng's project of digitally preserving Hong Kong's urban spaces threatened by redevelopment, and have a chance to explore his virtual 3D spaces with VR headsets!</p>
<p>Following the talk, we will have <strong>3 elections</strong> for the roles of Vice President, Junior Treasurer, and First Year Representative.</p>
<h3>Manifestos</h3>
<p>Manifestos for the two positions are now live! <a href="https://comp-soc.com/news/2024-10-10-oct-egm-manifestos/">Click here to view them.</a><br>
Please read on to find out how to add your own, if you are interested.</p>
<h3>EGM</h3>
<p>The positions we're electing are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Vice-President</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Organises monthly STMUs and other miscellaneous events with our sponsors.</li>
<li>Oversees working with our SIGs (Special Interest Groups).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Junior Treasurer</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Manage daily financial operations - including making reimbursements, maintaining budgets, and tracking transactions.</li>
<li>Gain hands-on experience in the financials of managing a £70,000+ balance sheet.</li>
<li>Obtain valuable insights into financial management and prepare for a potential future role as Treasurer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>1st Year Representative</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Responsible for communication between their year and the Society, and promotes events to their year.</li>
<li>Responsible for organising some of CompSoc's large projects and events, such as InfBall, HackTheBurgh or pwnedEd.</li>
<li>Gain an insight into the day-to-day of running CompSoc, and valuable experience in organising large scale society events.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are interested in applying for any of these positions, you need to:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Write a manifesto</strong> which will convince everyone to vote for you. It must be a <strong>maximum of 200 words</strong> and in PDF format. Submit them to <a href="mailto:committee@comp-soc.com">committee@comp-soc.com</a> with your full name and the position you're applying for in the subject (for example, Marton Nemeth, Vice-President). Include your name and position in the document (this does not count towards word count). The deadline to submit a manifesto is October 22nd at 18:00.</li>
</ol>
<p>Although it is possible to run impromptu on the day, submitting a manifesto will typically give you much better chances to win.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>You also need to prepare a speech. You will have strictly <strong>1 minute</strong> for your speech. You may get questions asked afterwards.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Student Tech Meet-Up</h3>
<p><a href="https://shiukaheng.com/">Shiu Ka Heng</a>, a graduate from Edinburgh will take us through "The Lost Metropolis: Immortalizing Hong Kong's Changing Landscapes in Virtual Reality."</p>
<p>Join us for a deep dive into how this interdisciplinary project is tackling the challenge of digitally preserving Hong Kong's urban spaces threatened by redevelopment. Discover the art and science behind large-scale 3D reconstruction, from robotics development for autonomous 3D capture to employing advanced techniques like Gaussian splatting. Heng will share insights into the project's journey, the hurdles overcome, and the latest in 3D reconstruction technology.</p>
<p><strong>You will also have the opportunity to glimpse into the project yourself through some VR headsets!</strong></p>
<p>Finally, we will, as always, have free pizza and drinks for you too.</p>
