On the first day of December, CompSoc hosted the annual Local Hack Day.
<p>Despite the imminent exams breathing down their necks, over 20 passionate hackers dedicated their day to come into AT and create something exciting and new.</p>
<p>The team <strong>“It’s Easy!”</strong> tackled the website redesign challenge, adding a little twist – using the provided Azure credits, they implemented facial recognition for members of their concept site! They make it look so… well, easy!</p>
&#x3C;img src="https://compsoc-edinburgh.github.io/uploads/2018-12-01-LHD/itsEasyTeam.jpg" alt="Team It's Easy" class="img-fluid">
<p>Team <strong>"Wuwin"</strong> took their shot at reinventing the wheel. Just not the one you're thinking of... To be more precise, a ring... They're bringing the classic drinking game Ring of Fire to the web!</p>

<p>Team <strong>"v.0.5"</strong> were building a game involving helicopters, paratroopers, and whatnot.</p>

<p><strong>Cody</strong> worked on <em>Monad for the digital era</em> (Not the same Monads you learnt about in Functional Programming)! It's essentially some sort of card game... And yes, that mouse is from a while ago.</p>

<p><strong>Dylan</strong> has taken up the Sisyphean task of developing a game with Haskell and ncurses. Press F to pay respects.</p>

<p>Team <strong>"ChachaVidhayak"</strong> developed AlcoMender, which picks an alcoholic beverage for you based on your mood that it detects through a picture! An interesting use of Machine Learning!</p>

<p>Finally, after going through countless bags of crisps, litres of Irn Bru and a dozen pizzas, the winners of our Local Hack Day challenges emerged:</p>
<h3>Best Overall Hack</h3>
