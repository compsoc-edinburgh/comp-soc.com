            We&apos;ve been working hard to make plans for the upcoming year
            that accommodate all of you, and part of this plan is to introduce
            Academic Families (AcFams)!
          </p>

          <p>
            Academic families is a new joint initiative between Compsoc and the
            School of Informatics. It will start in the 2024-25 academic year,
            and we aim to bring together students from all years within the
            School.
          </p>

          <p>
            Students in older years will &apos;adopt&apos; freshers, and
            it&apos;s a great way of helping the community, meeting new people,
            and having a good time together! Each family will consist of 10
            first-year Informatics students and 2 academic parents from the
            years above (UG2 - UG5). Students will have the opportunity to
            organise family events, as well as take part in larger events
            organised by the School of Informatics!
          </p>
