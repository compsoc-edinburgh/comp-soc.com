c:Ted4,<h2>Welcome Week Events</h2>
<p>In general, well-attented. Should do same quantity of events next year.</p>
<h3>Photo Scavenger Hunt</h3>
<ul>
<li>Least attended.</li>
<li>We should make it more related to computing things to stand out form other society's events.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Todo</h2>
<ul>
<li>Make articles on how to set up social events on CompSoc Committee Wiki</li>
<li>Update spreadsheet with newer email addresses to help next president.</li>
<li>Email AWSSIG and AlgoTradingSIG (see below).</li>
<li>Hoppers, Cascaders: talk about it next meeting.</li>
<li>Constitution amendments at EGM (see below).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sponsors</h2>
<ul>
<li>Optiver are yet to respond, particularly for HTB</li>
<li>Google will respond in November.</li>
<li>Goal is £15k which appears to be achievable.</li>
<li>If any committee members have contacts from internships or other networking then share with Fergus.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Social stuff</h2>
<ul>
<li>Look for partnership with Pilgrim Bar or Maki &#x26; Ramen (made from GameSoc).</li>
<li>Make partnership with Pilgrim as opposed to Bar 50 in the future.</li>
<li>Weekly low-effort event? Such as pub, movie, café night etc.
<ul>
<li>Two years ago café was tried but wasn't too popular, maybe combine with Project Share?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>STMU</h3>
<ul>
<li>Speakers ready (Wadler, Project Share).</li>
<li>Venue booked from 18:00 until 20:30, technically booked from 17:30 but someone else has it booked until 17:30 but says that they will finish at 16:00.</li>
</ul>
<h3>EGM</h3>
<ul>
<li>Positions open:
<ul>
<li>first year rep,</li>
<li>old person rep,</li>
<li>NEW: establish advisory role. See other important changes below.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Increase members required for SIG up to 10 people, see the SIG section below for details.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Graphics</h2>
<ul>
<li>Sponsors need to be finalised before printing cards.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Relationships with other societies</h2>
<ul>
<li>Friendship with MathsSoc will be established more in the future.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other important changes</h2>
<p>Ammir would like to help out with treasurer role, on-paper Sophie would stay as treasurer, and Ammir would 'advise'. Perhaps it could be called co-treasurer.</p>
<h2>HTB Planning</h2>
<ul>
<li>Hackathons UK representative (Steph, Discord username <code>chari</code>), good friend of Charlotte, who has agreed to help.</li>
<li>Definitely part of HTB team: Harsh (Discord username <code>undeadjoker</code>).</li>
<li>Committee HTB member: Sophie</li>
<li>Harsh should come to next committee meeting to decide how many to help out in the HTB team.
<ul>
<li>Also bring Aria because she organised it two years prior.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>SIGs</h2>
<ul>
<li>Constitution:
<ul>
<li>Any SIG that wants to be set up needs 4 members (of CompSoc) and clearly defined goals.</li>
<li>The 'leader' (for some definition of 'leader') gets to sit with the committee meetings.</li>
<li>SIGs do get financial support but it isn't defined how much.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We need to increase the required members from 4 up to 10.</li>
<li>TypeSIG
<ul>
<li>Established. It's up to them to do whatever they wants because we can trust the members.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>AWSSIG and AlgoTradingSIG
<ul>
<li>AWSSIG doesn't have enough members. We also don't like them being called AWSSIG, better would be CloudSIG.</li>
<li>AlgoTradingSIG doesn't have enough members too.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sophie will ask SIGs (including Tardis) how much money they need in the #sigs channels (in particular SIGINT).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cupboard</h2>
<ul>
<li>Games consoles moved to GameSoc.</li>
<li>Drawer (with membership cards, etc.) things were removed which were important and drawer disposed of (?).</li>
<li>Other things to be discussed next time.</li>
