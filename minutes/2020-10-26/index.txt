d:T97f,<p><strong>Present</strong>
Alexandra Purcarea, Tudor Finaru, Anabel Yong, Ananya Majumdar, Artemis Livingstone, Ryan Schuller, Elspeth Smith, Patrick Kage (SIGWeb), Daniel Kirkman, Samuel Macleod, Lars Thalian Morstad, Rokas Gudavicius</p>
<p><strong>Agenda</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Welcome new committee members</li>
<li>Donations</li>
<li>Upcoming events</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Discussion and Decisions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>New members:
<ul>
<li>New treasurer = Anabel Yong</li>
<li>New 1st year rep = Artemis Livingstone</li>
<li>Encouraged to read constitution and familiarise with SIG structure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Discord needs to be promoted further as it is now being used as primary mode of communication -> put it on the website homepage.</li>
<li>It is getting difficult to keep track of events => better coordination on the Google calendar is required, and adequate descriptions must be added with event details.</li>
<li>Calendar Later was discussed? Blocker: Kyle</li>
<li>RSS feed for calendar to Discord hasn't worked so far, but if it can be made to work the committee is happy to adopt this.</li>
<li>Secretary: needs to get instagram and twitter accounts back up and running.</li>
<li>Feedback survey: to be posted (social sec)</li>
<li>AcFam Adoption Night was a success - attendees are keep for regular events of similar formats</li>
<li>Budget surplus inciting donation conversation:
<ul>
<li>Particular causes we are keen to support include, but are not limited to, computer science promotion and support in primary schools.</li>
<li>Links for suggested causes were supplied, to be added.</li>
<li>To decide on who to donate to, a curated poll (similar to that used when Turing Trust was selected) could be used to also engage members</li>
<li>President has made a Slack thread for committee members to post suggestions of causes in one place</li>
<li>We could get involved with CodeDojo in more than a purely monetary capacity</li>
<li>Discussion RE: lump sum donation amount still pending</li>
<li>All outstanding debts as of this date are currently settled</li>
<li>Pay received from Optiver and G-Research</li>
<li>For lump sum donation: suggestion of multiple smaller installments, possibly to different recipients, was suggested and supported. This can then be spaced out to accommodate upcoming costs/financial uncertainty</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Secretary: news on website needs to be updated</li>
