<li>Main mode of streaming will be bot-ed Discord and Twitch</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>About 45-50 people attended collaborative event with WiSTEM :D</li>
<li>Received good feedback for games night</li>
<li>Discord moderation:
<ul>
<li>The server is growing a lot, this needs to be reflected on the website</li>
<li>There was an incident where some members had to be banned, this triggered a complete restructuring of the platform's moderation</li>
<li>We need to define a clear protocol</li>
<li>There is now a 'quarantine channel' to talk to individuals in question and understand what's happening, conversations in this channel will be one-to-one so as not to 'gang up' on the quarantined</li>
<li>This also provides a paper trail</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We are still paying for the old minecraft server
<ul>
<li>Maybe move to a new one?</li>
<li>Need to get rid of the old one</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Merchandise:
<ul>
<li>Teespring store, idea of prices for general merch and masks = pay per order</li>
<li>Ananya to ask Neil if he has any other ideas for distribution</li>
<li>Hoodies ~Â£20, masks ~Â£8?</li>
<li>Idea for donation: match price of items as donation</li>
<li>Need to come up with a framework for subsidisation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Events:
<ul>
<li>Saturday games nights</li>
<li>AcFam pub quiz</li>
<li>Higher lockdown means we need more events to keep people engaged</li>
<li>Christmas challenges?</li>
<li>People are concerned that their families didn't turn up but we can't do much about that</li>
<li>Received good feedback on the artsy challenge</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Donations:
<ul>
<li>There will be a poll on the committee slack, not voting means not being involved in the discussion</li>
<li>Final decision will be made in the next meeting</li>
<li>Initial installment of Â£1000, maybe more in the future</li>
</ul>
</li>
