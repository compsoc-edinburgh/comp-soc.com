Kyle Cotton, Lars Thalian Morstad, Dee Yeum, Yannik Nelson, Athiya Deviyani, Alan Paul, Alexandra Purcarea, Samuel Macleod, Patrick Kage, Gwion ao Rheinallt, George Gilligan, Kim Stonehouse, Ryan Schuller.</p>
<p><strong>Agenda</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Discussion of how the committee is run, and how the Slack should be moderated.</li>
<li>SigInt Finances.
<ul>
<li>Payment from sponsors has been slow. They are likely sponsoring PWNed next year so payment will likely come through soon.</li>
<li>SIGint want to use some of the leftover money on hardware to do security research. They will keep the sponsorship money.</li>
<li>SIGint will still have the founder's feast. CompSoc will subsidize this.</li>
<li>The commitee needs to be better at responding to slack messages.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>InfBall.
<ul>
<li>The school has offered to pay about £500 to support the event. The money should be spent mostly on staff tickets.</li>
<li>Neil has also suggested some staff to invite. Some additional staff has also been suggested by the committee.</li>
<li>Ticketing system has been made. Should be tested so tickets can be sold soon. Details should be finalized soon.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>HTB.
<ul>
<li>Due to the occupation the AT booking has been cancelled. For a lot of reasons having the event there is not good. May be legal, sponsor and personal issues. May make attendants uncomfortable.</li>
<li>More people can be fit in the IF, so we will likely fit anyone who would have been in AT.</li>
<li>The occupiers have agreed to retreat to the upper floors. However this is too big of a risk, as it depends on personal whims of the occupiers.</li>
<li>Sponsor swag has arrived and shopping has been done.</li>
<li>CompSoc challenge has been decided.</li>
<li>Still some details about risk assessment and banners/ merch to sort out.</li>
<li>The organizers for next year have to be selected.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Strikes.
<ul>
<li>The occupiers wanted us to publish that we "negotiated" with them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>AGM
<ul>
<li>Will be lecture shout out for new committee members. Deadline is by Friday 4pm 6th March 2020.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CreateED
<ul>
<li>The event has been downsized by a lot.</li>
<li>CompSoc were initially "open to sponsoring", however this doesn't mean we are definitely sponsoring.</li>
</ul>
</li>
