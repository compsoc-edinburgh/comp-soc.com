<li>Committee handover bowling sesh</li>
<li>Picnic in a few weeks time</li>
<li>And a picnic a few weeks after freshers week</li>
<li>Games night
<ul>

<li>Stored safely overnight, and actually stay at the event</li>
<li>Threat of hardware getting damaged or lost</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Future of CompSoc</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Being a member of CompSoc, what benefits do you get?</li>
<li>How many events are paid?</li>
<li>There‚Äôs no sense of community</li>
<li>STMUs: pizza, and sponsors present themselves, as well as other talks</li>
<li>We have a group split
<ul>
<li>Drinkers and non-drinkers</li>
<li>We need to cater for both, but appear to just cater for non drinkers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>MathSoc
<ul>
<li>has a lot of socials, most go to drinking, some go to talks</li>
<li>Liaise with them to not clash events</li>
<li>Has ‚Äúsub-committees‚Äù, board has managers for ‚Äúsocials‚Äù, etc.</li>
<li>Social manager has their own team that handles small stuff</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Constitutional change
<ul>
<li>for SIGs?</li>
<li>You must be in the same year as the year rep you are running for.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>HackSec should be appointed, not elected.
<ul>
<li>We can't have a complete newbie running things, Hack the Burgh is a valuable asset.</li>
<li>It requires dedication, we can't have people dropping out.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>STMUs are Vice President events, not SocialSec‚Äôs</li>
<li>Freshers: are very keen, and need to be shown the ropes</li>
<li>The circle is shrinking, we need to improve the community</li>
<li>We need to be closer with Informatics, School of Maths shows up to MathSoc events</li>
<li>Emails
<ul>
<li>we can get them sent to all the informatics, but we don‚Äôt want to spam. NH is okay with this.</li>
<li>School of Maths has weekly newsletters, which include ‚ÄúMathSoc is doing‚Ä¶‚Äù</li>
<li>Informatics has weekly blog emails, if we can get them to change it to a weekly newsletter, containing the blog update, compsoc, and general events</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As a tech society, we don‚Äôt have a lot of tech
<ul>
<li>Designated projects people can work on as a society</li>
<li>WebSIG needs to be expanded and have their own projects</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>2:["$","$Lc",null,{"contentHtml":"$d","title":"2017-03-01","modifiedAt":"$D2025-02-27T22:28:45.075Z"}]
