c:T1a24,<p>The first official meeting held for the 2017-18 committee.</p>
<p><strong>Present</strong></p>
<p>Qais Patankar, Elena Lapinskaitė, Joe, Cameron Sharp, Harry Reeder, Craig Snowden, Angus Shaw</p>
<p><strong>General Agenda</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Making the “CompSoc Members” Facebook group public</p>
<ul>
<li>Currently a closed group - no tagging/interaction with those outside the group</li>
<li>Fast joining - multiple admins approve new additions quickly</li>
<li>Public group means anyone can post which will give greater exposure</li>
<li>It’s already easy to join and post, there is very little screening except turning down obviously fake accounts</li>
<li>Closed is easier to protect privacy of post-event photos</li>
<li>Voted all in favour of keeping the group closed</li>
<li>Issue closed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Events for older students</p>
<ul>
<li>Most events and advertising geared towards first and second years</li>
<li>Contact other groups and ask for ideas - EdIntelligence, for example</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sponsorship decks</p>
<ul>
<li>Need a new one to replace the one from 2016-2017</li>
<li>Possibility of more informally contacting non-tech companies - e.g. La Favorita or other pizza companies and requesting discounts in exchange for displaying their logos</li>
<li>Probably best saved for a specific meeting</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Block Bookings</p>
<ul>
<li>We won’t need to use this as we don’t plan regular use of EUSA venues</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/hreeder/slyrc">SlyRC</a></p>
<ul>
<li>TechSec working on it - crossover between IRC and Slack</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ambiguities in the constitution</p>
<ul>
<li>Constitution is open to all</li>
<li>Anyone can request changes on Github</li>
<li>We can address these at the EGM in September/October where the 1st year rep is elected</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>CompSoc merchandise</p>
<ul>
<li>Hoodies/t-shirts?
<ul>
<li>Expensive</li>
<li>Especially since most people don’t even pay for membership</li>
<li>Possibly give tshirts out for free with membership (good draw for signing up at freshers week stall)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Committee hoodies/tshirts
<ul>
<li>General “Committee” printings on hoodies</li>
<li>Useful for events, especially fresher’s week</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New Flag
<ul>
<li>Asked previous committee how the old flag was obtained</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Framing old flag
<ul>
<li>Or just the logo if we cut it out</li>
<li>Where would we put it?</li>
<li>Framed in Appleton Tower</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stickers
<ul>
<li>Good to have at the start of the year</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New logo
<ul>
<li>Bring back old logos?</li>
<li>‘100 Years of Turing/Geek Pride’ a possibility (but updated)</li>
<li>Cat with sunglasses logo (doesn’t really embody CompSoc though)</li>
<li>Possibly bringing back Appleton Tower AT-AT given we’ll be moving back there</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Card
<ul>
<li>Updated with new logo</li>
<li>Possibly bringing back Appleton Tower AT-AT given we’ll be moving back theree</li>
<li>Possibly upgrading design of card, although this can get expensive</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fresher's Week</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Scavenger Hunt</p>
<ul>
<li>First (and last) one done in 2015</li>
<li>Good daytime event for meeting people</li>
<li>Requires only minimal preparation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pub crawl</p>
<ul>
<li>Tradition, easy to organise</li>
<li>Probably no need to contact pubs in advance to let them know of our coming</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Night of Games</p>
<ul>
<li>Will need a fair amount of equipment</li>
<li>We have some older equipment (e.g. Xbox 360) already</li>
<li>Individual members needed to bring most of the equipment</li>
<li>Possibly request some equipment from members</li>
<li>Vice-President met with Neil Heatley and asked him about booking Appleton Tower, will probably be okay but dependent on the contractor - unlikely possibility of it not being ready</li>
<li>Old photos at tbrb.imgur.com</li>
<li>Collaboration with GameSoc - their secretary has asked us to contact her</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Activities Fair</p>
<ul>
<li>Need a few people to informally hang around the stall</li>
<li>Have membership cards ready for the day - allow cards</li>
<li>Have (cheap) tshirts ready, with printing, if possible</li>
<li>Possibly give tshirts out for free with membership (good draw for freshers)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Potential Future Events</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>CompSoc Trip(s)</p>
<ul>
<li>Poll was done back in January - winners were Centre for Computing History (Cambridge) &#x26; Natural History/Science Museum (London)</li>
<li>Would be easier and cheaper to go somewhere closer to home e.g. Glasgow Science Museum</li>
<li>Should it be open to freshers and advertised in fresher’s week, or planned/signups taken now from existing members and then done earlier in the year?</li>
<li>Would be good to get help of SocialSec or any related SIGs</li>
<li>TripSig suggested by Joe</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Laserquest</p>
<ul>
<li>Has been done before, through Eventbrite</li>
<li>Low quality equipment is to be expected</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bowling</p>
<ul>
<li>Last time, RSVPs were taken in advance but not many of them showed up</li>
<li>Money was taken on the day/afterwards</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>BBQ</p>
<ul>
<li>Is legal in meadows (although encouraged to use designated spots)</li>
<li>Having people bring their own food is the best plan</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>PreHack 2017</p>
<ul>
<li>Needs its own meeting - this is the biggest item on the event list</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other hackathons</p>
<ul>
<li>Last year we went to StudentHack V and StacsHack, amongst others. These have varying levels of organisation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>InfBall &#x26; Christmas Dinner</p>
<ul>
<li>SocialSec is working on this currently</li>
<li>Good to merge these into one event, given we have little experience with them previously</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Community submitted issues</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Financial reports</p>
<ul>
<li>Financial report isn’t comprehensive - many sponsors and assets are missing</li>
<li>We need a bank statement-style spreadsheet of all money in and out</li>
<li>We can also use GitHub project to keep track of money due and owed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Concerns about ethics of big name corporate sponsors</p>
<ul>
<li>Currently we have a mix of grassroots and big names</li>
<li>We need sponsorship from Amazon, Bloomberg etc, they provide much of our funding</li>
<li>We can’t afford to let them go, but will try to have local companies too</li>
</ul>
</li>
