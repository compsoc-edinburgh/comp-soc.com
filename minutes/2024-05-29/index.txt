<li>Hold events on weekends to avoid clashing with the activities fair.</li>
</ul>
<p>Scavenger Hunt:</p>
<ul>
<li>Last year's scavenger hunt was successful with about 40-50 participants so keen to do again next year.</li>

<ul>
<li>Schedule a brunch during Freshers' Week to attract attendees.</li>
