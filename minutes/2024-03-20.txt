<h1>Meetings notes</h1>
<h2>Constitutional Amendments:</h2>
<p>The committee conducted a thorough review of the proposed changes to the Compsoc constitution, discussing each section in turn:</p>
<h3>Membership</h3>
<p>Proposal: Add Clause - "All matriculated Informatics students are considered default Compsoc members unless they opt out."
Discussion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Could significantly boost reported membership</li>
<li>Ensures all Informatics students are represented and covered by constitution</li>
<li>May require changes to membership tracking and engagement reporting
Decision: Clause added</li>
</ul>
<h3>Committee Oversight</h3>
<p>Proposal: Add clause allowing executive officers to unilaterally issue warnings to underperforming committee members.
Discussion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Concerns over potential for abuse due to vague criteria for "underperformance"</li>
<li>Suggestions to require co-signing by another executive or allow appeals process
Decision: clause added.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Quorum and Voting</h3>
<p>Proposals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clarify that SIG leaders count towards quorum if present but are not required for quorum.</li>
<li>Specify that no individual gets multiple votes even if holding multiple roles.
Discussion:</li>
<li>Current wording ambiguous on SIG leader impact on quorum</li>
<li>Low probability of one person holding enough roles to significantly alter outcomes
Decision: only elected committee roles are counted towards quorum, but SIG presidents can still vote.</li>
</ul>
<h3>SIG Assets on Dissolution</h3>
<p>Proposal: Add clause specifying SIG assets transfer to Compsoc if SIG dissolves, with allowance for exceptions by committee vote.
Discussion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Question of what currently happens to SIG assets and funds if SIG shuts down</li>
<li>Some SIGs have valuable assets from independent grants that they don't want seized</li>
<li>Acknowledgment that Compsoc technically owns all SIG assets as subgroups of Compsoc<br>
Decision: Each SIG dissolution should be addressed on a case-by-case basis. By default, SIG assets belong and must be returned to CompSoc, but exceptions may be granted.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Legal Status</h3>
<p>Proposal: Remove Clause 1.5.6 prohibiting Compsoc incorporating as an independent legal entity.
Discussion: Clause seen as redundant with existing requirements to operate under EUSA oversight.<br>
Decision: Clause removed unanimously.</p>
<h2>AGM and EGM Planning:</h2>
<p>AGM scheduled for Wednesday, April 3, 6pm, Informatics Forum Room G.03.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some concern raised over potential conflict with SDP Industry Day event same afternoon</li>
<li>Consensus that AGM should still have adequate turnout as Industry Day will end by 7pm</li>
<li>Agreement to proceed as scheduled and send announcement to members immediately to maximize notice</li>
</ul>
<h3>STMU Talks:</h3>
<p>Ali reports difficulty confirming speakers for AGM.</p>
<ul>
<li>Faculty speakers citing exam schedules and end-of-term workload as reason for unavailability</li>
<li>Committee suggests broadening search to PhD students, postdocs and alumni in industry</li>
</ul>
<h3>TODO:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Draft AGM announcement emails and send to membership by end of today</li>
<li>All committee members to widely advertise openings and encourage candidates to run for election</li>
<li>All committee members to suggest potential speakers to Ali ASAP</li>
