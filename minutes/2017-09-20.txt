c:T908,<p>The first meeting during the 2017-18 academic year.</p>
<p><strong>Present</strong></p>
<p>Qais Patankar, Elena Lapė, Ginte Petrulionyte, Harry Reeder, Viktorija Lukosiute, Joshua Green, Nicholas Lynch</p>
<p><strong>Events</strong></p>
<p>We discussed potential locations and plans for our future events, and dates for PreHack and LocalHackDay.</p>
<p><strong>Community</strong></p>
<p>Engaging more with the community by doing regular Tuesday socials, and ensuring that we make pubs part of the STMU format.</p>
<p>Possibility of doing day-after-pub-crawl hungover nachos. Collaboration with other societies for social events. Making sure events carefully align to coursework deadlines, including coursework specific events.</p>
<p>A big secret event is being planned.</p>
<p>We have a blog where we can post a log our newsletters, do postmortems of events, and can submit great photos (+ an email address to share these). We can also share hackathon achievements.</p>
<p>Year reps need more responsibility, and could host coursework nights in AT (compulsory for courses with over 80 of the year enrolled, otherwise at their discretion).</p>
<p>Outreach outside Informatics as being achieved via similar schools, and a family system is something we’ll be working on next semester for the following year.</p>
<p><strong>SIGs</strong></p>
<p>We acknowledged that SIGs are a big part of CompSoc, and that they often need a guaranteed future. Inclusion into the constitution is planned, and a voting plan for SIGs needs to be included too.</p>
<p>JP Morgan is interested in running a Cyber Security event, something we can pass through SIGINT.</p>
<p>A networking SIG “SIGNet” was requested by Cameron Sharp:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some committee found the name confusing, and thought it was similar to SIGINT. netSIG was a suggested alternative.</li>
<li>For a networking SIG, the committee voted: 8 for, 0 against, 0 abstain (pass)</li>
</ul>
<p>Books: we have books, what do we do with them?</p>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<p>We have a bar sponsorship, and can issue their e-cards. We also have a planned field trip to Glasgow, with a potential visit to JP Morgan’s offices.</p>
<p>Hoodies are hopefully happening this time, with a potential for SIG logos to be included. Stickers are to also happen.</p>2:["$","$Lb",null,{"contentHtml":"$c","title":"2017-09-20","modifiedAt":"$D2024-08-01T22:22:27.818Z"}]
