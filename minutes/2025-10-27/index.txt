<h2><strong>Items</strong></h2>
<p><strong>AI and accessibility hackathon</strong>  </p>
<p>Anna approached by Aurora Constantin from school of informatics  </p>
<p>Google and skyscanner as sponsors (unsure if this is actually obtained or just planned targets?)  </p>
<p>Asking for help from compsoc  </p>
<p>Could be promotion, making challenges, organisational advice  </p>
<p>Planned to be in February  </p>
<p>Kacper - Don’t want it to be like cauldron labs event, i.e. make sure compsoc doesn’t take too much of the burden</p>
<p><strong>EGM</strong>  </p>
<p>uni events team aware of everything going on  </p>
<p>booked from 5-9pm  </p>
<p>Don’t share bending spoons recordings publicly, can stop/start livestream around it, post recording privately  </p>
<p>Kay has camera with mini-hdmi out which can be used for livestream through OBS, need to get adapter to HDMI  </p>
<p>Emily - Need to rewrite rust code for scraping members list because uni changed auth stuff</p>
<p>Kaiwen won’t be allowed to play video during election, unfair as not explicitly stated in rules</p>
<p><strong>Kacper - Web3 society hackathon collab request</strong>  </p>
<p>Originally wanted to do it in sem1, rejected because of HtB, so moved to sem2  </p>
<p>Allegedly revolut, solana, etc. are willing to support  </p>
<p>“Crypto HtB I guess”  </p>
<p>AI agents, stablecoins, mini apps, DeFi  </p>
<p>Potentially say compsoc can’t help them unless they’re a SIG  </p>
<p>Ask if QuantSIG are interested?  </p>
<p>Kacper will get some of the web3 people to a future committee meeting to talk more about it</p>
<p><strong>Cloudsig</strong>  </p>
<p>Kacper doesn’t want to vote about them today, technically they don’t need a quorum by the constitution, but practically they should need one because the SIG has been dead for 2 years so no direct line of succession  </p>
<p>Merlin - point of quorum vote is to prevent priv-esc takeover of committee by small group of  people  </p>
<p>They have a budget, ~£350/year, over about 7 sessions, project share is more like £20 per session for snacks and stuff, list of sponsors to cold-email, might want to check for ones which have bad reputations (BDS lists) after getting responses  </p>
<p>Start running regular events in Sem2 to give more time for planning, start with a big intro event (AWS workshop), do regular events every 2 weeks  </p>
<p>Smaller businesses are more amenable for speakers  </p>
<p>Michael glienicke would be likely to be willing to do a talk - might be useful for getting more traction with non 1st years  </p>
<p>SIGINT collab, CTF with cloud theme, e.g. misconfigured s3 buckets, …  </p>
<p>Anna, Kacper - Important to advertise aggressively to try and get more non-1st years  </p>
<p>Push back Sem2 event by a week or 2 because lots of people won’t get back for a bit after christmas hols  </p>
<p>Emily - clearly are taking it seriously, have proper planning for events, concur around importance of getting non 1st-years, diversifying committee outside of just 1 friend group to make SIG more sustainable, finding people who have more expertise for teaching  </p>
<p>Kacper wants to sign off on any announcements before they get sent  </p>
<p>Try to get access to mailing list for advertising  </p>
<p>Anna - vote on cloudsig quickly to make it easier to do planning, events, advertising  </p>
<p>Don’t have enough of exec commitee for vote to take place this week  </p>
<p>kameran’s busy with HtB so might not be able to help out  </p>
<p>CloudSIG back for halloween - frankenstein</p>2:["$","$Lb",null,{"contentHtml":"$c","title":"2025-10-27","modifiedAt":"$D2025-10-29T12:59:52.718Z"}]
