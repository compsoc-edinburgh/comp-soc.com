<li>Futures Institute idea for venue so Godfrey will email and ask them.

<li>The Fair went well, good attendance, engaging speeches, and raised awareness of SIGs.</li>
<li>Raffle was effective fundraising.</li>
<li>The poster boards were bad an ineffective.</li>
<li>The advertising was done too late for the event.</li>
<li>We can get a team to do promotion and different aspects of it.</li>
