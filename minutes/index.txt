10:Tb0e,# CompSoc Committee Meeting 2024-02-24

Minutes taken by Charlotte Ausel, EDI Rep.

Attendees: Anastasia, Agam, Godfrey (online), Cat (online), Leo, Vojtech, Charlotte, Ol, Merlin,
Vincent, Kacper, Kameran, Marton, Lucas, Eugene, Tomas (online), Elisa

Apologies: Lewis

## Questions for Edinburgh Venture Point (EVP)

1. Are you paying someone for the website or why is it equiv. 4 h of an hourly wage? It's a standard
   WordPress subscription; they didn't have the tech expertise to create this at a cheaper cost.

2. Why is CompSoc doing this? CompSoc has a great atmosphere for creating things and has great
   potential to produce successful startups. Some committee members responded with the fact that
   this isn't really something that CompSoc does, since other SIGs are directly technology related,
   whereas EVP would only tangentially be related to tech. CompSoc will also be the first group to
   get the chance to support EVP should it go successfully.
3. Did CompSoc members turn up to their first event, if not, then isn't it unlikely that CompSoc
   members will enjoy it? Some CompSoc members did indeed show up, and it was suggested that EVP
   joining CompSoc as a SIG could help boost their numbers too. On a technical note, they already
   have the minimum required support of 10 members and a leader for creation of a SIG.

## Other points

It was mentioned that the startup fund of 500 GBP was pathetically low should it be spread amongst
several groups. Overall, the finances, though better than last time, were still a bit
questionable. Still, it's realistic enough to consider supporting.

After the EVP presenters left the room, the committee decided that — since the school technically
supported CompSoc financially under the premise that a pitching-style event would happen, as well as
the fact that Edinburgh AI received a lot of funds for their AI Expo shortly after their
establishment — it was feasible to support them with some amount of money.

Some committee members objected outright to supporting EVP without them becoming a SIG. So we
decided to vote on the following questions:

1. Should EVP become a SIG?

2. If yes, should we support them with £1k?

3. If no, should we support them with £500?

## Vote

Results:
SIG? Yes 12, No 4, Abstain 1
Money 1k: Yes 11, No 6, Abstain 1

Vincent will now initiate the process for EVP to become a SIG and the committee will give them £1k
in the future for their events.

- 5 min provided to complete the form
- Votes cast: 21 via form, 5 by advance proxy, 2 via DM to Ali due to technical issues

## Vote Result

- Yes to impeachment: 24 (86%)
- No to impeachment: 4
- Abstain: 0

Meeting called to order at 12:15 PM.

## 1. Collaboration with the School of Informatics

- The School of Informatics is open to having both alcoholic and non-alcoholic events, recognizing the need for both types of events.
- CompSoc can support the school by advertising events as CompSoc events with the Informatics logo more prominently.
- In return, CompSoc socials will be further subsidized by the school, even more than the current situation where the school provides a significant amount of money.
- This collaboration could lead to Informatics students joining CompSoc, benefiting both the society and the school.

## 2. Expanding the committee and reaching out to other schools

- CompSoc currently has around 1,500 official members, with a focus on Informatics students.
- Vincent suggests targeting STEM students and those from other fields like finance or business, as it could be beneficial for collaborations, projects, or starting businesses together.
- Concerns were raised about expanding the committee too quickly, as it could lead to difficulties in management and communication.
- There are suggestions to keep the core committee small and establish connections with other societies through existing committee members or volunteers.
- The SIG (Special Interest Group) structure allows for small group activities while maintaining a manageable core committee size.
- Expanding the committee should be done gradually, based on demand and workload, rather than creating roles for the sake of titles or CV boosting.
- Collaborations with other societies can be achieved through existing committee members, such as the example of the Mathematics society's social secretary also being a year representative for CompSoc.
- The focus should be on establishing connections and collaborations first, before creating dedicated roles within the committee.

## 3. Non-alcoholic events and attracting a diverse range of members

- CompSoc currently attracts two main groups: academically inclined individuals who enjoy technical talks and those who enjoy drinking and socializing.
- The society should aim to create a middle ground that caters to a wider range of interests among the 1,800 CompSoc members.
- Pub nights can be intimidating for some members, especially if they don't know anyone or feel pressure to drink alcohol.
- Incorporating activities like board games, pool, darts, or bowling alongside pub nights could make events more inclusive and less intimidating for new members.
- Completely non-alcoholic events should also be considered to accommodate members who may not attend events with alcohol due to religious or other reasons.
- The Christmas market event was a successful example of an event that attracted a diverse group of members.
- Other event ideas include movie screenings for popular film releases, which could be subsidized by CompSoc and followed by a social activity.
- The goal is to find a balance of events that appeal to the majority of members, considering factors that attract or deter attendance.
- A vote or survey on the Discord server and Instagram could help gauge member interests and preferences for events.

## 4. Revamping Student Tech Meetups (STMUs)

- STMUs have seen low attendance when there isn't an AGM or EGM, with only about 20 people, including committee members, attending the last non-AGM/EGM STMU.
- Akrit suggested that the current format of STMUs, with highly academic talks, may not appeal to a broad range of members and can feel like an extension of their university lectures.
- The goal is to make STMUs more accessible, engaging, and appealing to encourage attendance and participation.
- The proposed structure includes a more general talk followed by an academic one, catering to different interests and backgrounds.
- Networking opportunities and sponsor stalls could be incorporated during breaks, but logistics and the value for sponsors should be carefully considered.
- Concerns were raised about the feasibility of sponsor stalls, as it may be difficult for sponsors to justify the cost and effort of attending for a short duration, especially if they have to compete with other activities like pizza breaks.
- Improving the streaming setup and investing in a dedicated camera for live streaming and recording events could enhance the professionalism and reach of STMUs.
- A budget of around £1000 could be allocated for a proper streaming setup, ensuring consistent quality and ease of use.
- Speakers should be screened to ensure they deliver engaging talks, balancing academic content with accessibility for a broader audience.
- The inclusion of both academic and general talks is crucial to maintain the interest of those who appreciate the academic content while also catering to a wider audience.
- Advertising STMUs and other events on social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok, or Reels can help attract more attendees and provide insight into the event atmosphere.
- Collaboration with societies like the Hoppers and Formula Student was discussed to include more people from other fields.
- The social media officer will be involved to film and promote events on social media platforms.

## 5. Merchandise and branding

- The current merchandise, such as hoodies with prominently displayed committee titles (e.g., President, Vice President, Secretary), may be intimidating or unappealing to some members.
- New merchandise ideas include quarter zips or jumpers with subtle CompSoc branding, such as the logo and the member's name or committee position if applicable.
- Committee members should have the option to choose between different merchandise styles, such as quarter zips or jumpers, and have their names or positions embroidered.
- A merchandise store could be set up, offering items made to order, with a system for members to collect their purchases at designated events or times.
- The logistics of the merchandise store were discussed, with the possibility of having a 15-minute window at weekly events for members to collect their orders.
- Freshers' Week was identified as an excellent opportunity to sell merchandise and attract new members.
- Other branding suggestions include designing and purchasing a CompSoc flag, banner, and tablecloth for events, which could be added to the Secretary's responsibilities.
- The committee discussed the possibility of offering pink quarter zips as a unique branding option, depending on the design and consensus among members.

## 6. Miscellaneous topics

- CompSoc should focus on creating content for social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok to showcase events, attract new members, and provide insight into the event atmosphere.
- The social media officer will be responsible for filming events and creating engaging content for various platforms.
- The annual report and the discord mods voting process need to be addressed and planned, with the Vice President taking the lead on the voting process.
- A handover of roles and responsibilities should be conducted before the summer break to ensure a smooth transition.
- The committee discussed the appointment of Discord moderators, with the aim of having three moderators appointed by the committee before opening applications for additional moderators.
- The Fergus emphasized the importance of committee members setting their Discord notifications to "All messages" for the committee chat to ensure timely responses and avoid delays in decision-making.
- The committee agreed to schedule additional meetings throughout the summer to plan for Freshers' Week and other upcoming events.

## Action Items

- Fergus to discuss collaboration opportunities with the School of Informatics and relevant individuals.
- Create a plan for expanding connections with other societies and schools through existing committee members and volunteers.
- Brainstorm and plan a diverse range of events, including non-alcoholic options, and conduct a vote or survey to gauge member interests.
- Revamp STMUs to be more engaging and accessible, incorporating a mix of general and academic talks, networking opportunities, and improved streaming setup.
- Allocate a budget for a dedicated streaming setup and camera for STMUs and other events.
- Design and order new merchandise, focusing on subtle branding and committee identification, and explore options for a merchandise store.
- Set up a merchandise store with a system for order collection at events or designated times.
- Create a content plan for social media platforms to showcase events, attract new members, and provide insight into the event atmosphere.
- Address the annual report and constitution amendment voting process, with the Vice President taking the lead on the voting process.
- Conduct a handover of roles and responsibilities before the summer break.
- Appoint three Discord moderators and set up an application process for additional moderators.
- Committee members to set their Discord notifications to "All messages" for the committee chat.
- Schedule additional meetings throughout the summer to plan for Freshers' Week and other upcoming events.

# Meetings notes

## Constitutional Amendments:

The committee conducted a thorough review of the proposed changes to the Compsoc constitution, discussing each section in turn:

### Membership

Proposal: Add Clause - "All matriculated Informatics students are considered default Compsoc members unless they opt out."
Discussion:

- Could significantly boost reported membership
- Ensures all Informatics students are represented and covered by constitution
- May require changes to membership tracking and engagement reporting
  Decision: Clause added

### Committee Oversight

Proposal: Add clause allowing executive officers to unilaterally issue warnings to underperforming committee members.
Discussion:

- Concerns over potential for abuse due to vague criteria for "underperformance"
- Suggestions to require co-signing by another executive or allow appeals process
  Decision: clause added.

### Quorum and Voting

Proposals:

- Clarify that SIG leaders count towards quorum if present but are not required for quorum.
- Specify that no individual gets multiple votes even if holding multiple roles.
  Discussion:
- Current wording ambiguous on SIG leader impact on quorum
- Low probability of one person holding enough roles to significantly alter outcomes
  Decision: only elected committee roles are counted towards quorum, but SIG presidents can still vote.

### SIG Assets on Dissolution

Proposal: Add clause specifying SIG assets transfer to Compsoc if SIG dissolves, with allowance for exceptions by committee vote.
Discussion:

- Question of what currently happens to SIG assets and funds if SIG shuts down
- Some SIGs have valuable assets from independent grants that they don't want seized
- Acknowledgment that Compsoc technically owns all SIG assets as subgroups of Compsoc  
  Decision: Each SIG dissolution should be addressed on a case-by-case basis. By default, SIG assets belong and must be returned to CompSoc, but exceptions may be granted.

### Legal Status

Proposal: Remove Clause 1.5.6 prohibiting Compsoc incorporating as an independent legal entity.
Discussion: Clause seen as redundant with existing requirements to operate under EUSA oversight.  
Decision: Clause removed unanimously.

## AGM and EGM Planning:

AGM scheduled for Wednesday, April 3, 6pm, Informatics Forum Room G.03.

- Some concern raised over potential conflict with SDP Industry Day event same afternoon
- Consensus that AGM should still have adequate turnout as Industry Day will end by 7pm
- Agreement to proceed as scheduled and send announcement to members immediately to maximize notice

### STMU Talks:

Ali reports difficulty confirming speakers for AGM.

- Faculty speakers citing exam schedules and end-of-term workload as reason for unavailability
- Committee suggests broadening search to PhD students, postdocs and alumni in industry

### TODO:

- Draft AGM announcement emails and send to membership by end of today
- All committee members to widely advertise openings and encourage candidates to run for election
- All committee members to suggest potential speakers to Ali ASAP

> Discussion centered around constitution change

**Present (9)**: Fergus (President), Aurora (School Rep), Arin (2nd Year Rep), Tomas (3rd year Rep), Ali (VP), Cat (Tech Sec), Vincent (First Year Rep), Elisa (Treasurer), Chives (Old Person Rep)

Minutes by AI, tweaked by Vincent.

Meeting opened at 5:04pm.

Fergus began by discussing the agenda for the meeting, which included the constitution rewrite, SIG formalization, voting procedures, committee roles, quorum, impeachment processes, and merch sales.

# Constitution Rewrite Intro

Fergus outlined proposed changes to the constitution, including formalizing Special Interest Groups (SIGs), updating financial procedures, and clarifying impeachment protocols.

Ali suggested maintaining a list of active SIGs on the CompSoc website to improve transparency and allow for easy updating. This would definitively show which SIGs are currently a part of CompSoc.

The committee discussed quorum requirements. It was proposed that quorum be set at 75% of voting members, which would be approximately 15 people based on the current committee size.

There was debate over whether SIG Presidents should count towards reaching quorum or just as general votes. The initial proposal was to have them count as votes but not for quorum, to avoid a situation where SIG presidents could band together to overrule the core committee.

In terms of creating new SIGs, it was agreed this should require a vote by the committee. The exact process still needs to be formalized further.

SIG dissolution procedures were also discussed. It was agreed there needs to be a clearly documented process for disbanding a SIG, either voluntarily by the SIG itself or by CompSoc if needed.

There was discussion about having different levels or categories for the types of votes and decisions made in meetings:

- Trivial decisions that don't require quorum unless challenged
- Decisions requiring a simple majority vote
- Major decisions requiring a full quorum vote

# SIG Formalization

Building on the [prior discussion](https://comp-soc.com/minutes/2024-01-17), the committee went into more details on formal policies and procedures for SIGs.

It was reiterated that the official active SIGs will be listed on the CompSoc website. A page will be created listing the SIGs, which can be easily updated.

Vincent suggested creating a SIG handbook that would outline all the policies SIGs need to follow, serving as a code of conduct. This could include things like:

- Requiring at least one SIG officer to attend CompSoc meetings
- Procedures for handling finances and budgets
- Rules around branding, logos, sponsorships
- Process for booking rooms and resources
- Protocols for elections and leadership transitions
- Policies for external communications and partnerships

The handbook would be issued to all SIG presidents/officers. It was also suggested to have a training/onboarding process for new incoming SIG presidents each year to make sure they understand the rules and their responsibilities.

In terms of SIG termination and dissolution, a clear process was outlined:

- If a SIG becomes inactive or is being mismanaged, it will be put on a 1-year review period by the committee
- During this time, the SIG will need to demonstrate that it is operating properly, holding events, has membership engagement, and is following all policies
- After the 1-year review, a 2/3 majority vote by the committee is required to formally terminate the SIG
- If a SIG itself wants to voluntarily shut down, the SIG President must submit a formal letter to the committee declaring their intention to dissolve
- A 30-day grace period will be given for any SIG members to express interest in taking over leadership of the SIG
- If no one volunteers to continue the SIG after 30 days, it will be officially dissolved

Potential penalties for SIGs who are found to be violating the agreed handbook policies were discussed:

- Withholding or reducing SIG funding allocations
- Placing restrictions on the SIG's ability to book rooms or event spaces under the CompSoc banner
- Limits on posting announcements and communications to the wider CompSoc membership
- In severe cases, the committee can vote to remove the SIG's dedicated seat on the CompSoc committee

# Voting Procedures

The committee unanimously agreed to switch to using ranked choice voting for CompSoc elections. This applies to votes by the general membership, such as electing new committee officers.

Fergus shared that the Ranked Pairs algorithm will be used to calculate the winners. In a ranked choice system, voters will rank all the candidates in order of their preference. The Ranked Pairs algorithm then uses these rankings to determine the overall winner, taking into account the relative preferences between each candidate pair.

A Python script to implement the Ranked Pairs calculation already exists, but may need some cleaning up and additional testing before use. Chives volunteered to get the script ready for the next election cycle.

# Committee Structure and Roles

The current committee structure and roles were reviewed. There are 13 core roles that will be maintained going forward:

- President
- Vice President
- Secretary
- Treasurer
- EDI Rep
- Technical Secretary
- Social Secretary
- Graphic Designer
- 4 Year Representatives (one for each year - 1st through 4th)
- Old Person Rep
- Social Media Officer (New Role)

A new role of Social Media Officer will be added to the core committee. This person will be in charge of managing the society's social media accounts, working on digital marketing campaigns, analyzing engagement metrics, and assisting with community outreach efforts. They will work closely with the Graphic Designer and Social Secretary on visual designs and branding.

It was clarified that there will be only one Graphic Designer sitting on the core committee. However, the Graphic Designer can build a team of deputies/assistants to help with tasks as needed. Those deputy designers will not have committee voting rights.

There was discussion about the role of the School of Informatics Representative. Traditionally, the School Rep has been a voting member of the CompSoc committee. However, it was agreed that this is no longer required.

Going forward, the School Rep will not automatically be a member of the core committee. However, they are welcome to attend committee meetings if they wish. The committee can also vote to grant the School Rep voting privileges on a year-by-year basis if it is deemed necessary for tighter coordination with the Informatics department (requires 2/3 majority).

# Quorum and Voting

The requirements for reaching quorum in official committee votes was discussed. Quorum will be defined as 75% of the core committee roles being present (and 2 of those being executive).

With the current proposed structure of 14 committee roles, quorum would be 10 people (rounding up from 9.33).

It was emphasized that the SIG seats on the committee do NOT count towards reaching quorum, as they are not core committee roles. However, if present, SIG representatives are still allowed to vote as normal.

Certain categories of major decisions will always require quorum to be met in order to proceed to a vote:

- Any changes to the CompSoc constitution
- Votes to formally create or dissolve a SIG
- Impeachment votes to remove a committee member
- Any decisions that are deemed irreversible or highly sensitive in nature

For all other general votes and decisions, quorum is not a requirement. However, there will be a process for members to petition and trigger a quorum requirement for a particular vote if they feel it is necessary:

- The petition must contain at least 15 verified signatures of CompSoc members
- The petition can be submitted up to 24 hours before the scheduled vote
- If validated, quorum will then be required for that particular vote to be binding

## Impeachment Process

There can now be multiple avenues that can trigger an impeachment vote:

1. If a complaint is submitted against a committee member that includes at least 15 verifiable signatures of CompSoc student EUSA members
2. If 2/3 of the current committee members vote to initiate impeachment proceedings
3. If the School of Informatics Head of Student Services submits a formal request for impeachment

Once an impeachment process is triggered, a dedicated hearing will be held by the committee:

- The committee member in question will be given the opportunity to respond to the complaints and present their case
- The committee will then hold a vote after this hearing
- A 2/3 majority is required to advance the impeachment to a full EGM
- If the 2/3 threshold is not met, the impeachment fails and the member remains in their role

If the committee vote passes, an Emergency General Meeting (EGM) will be called with the full CompSoc membership:

- The EGM must be announced to all members and the details communicated
- A formal motion will be raised to remove the committee member from their role
- Time will be given for statements from both the complainants and the defending committee member
- After arguments are heard, the full EGM will vote on if the committee member should be removed from their role
- A 2/3 majority of the EGM attendees is required to successfully impeach and remove the officer
- If the vote fails, the committee member will remain in their position

# Merchandise Profit Margins

Vincent raised concerns about the very slim profit margins CompSoc is currently making from selling branded merchandise. He argued that the prices need to be increased to make the effort worthwhile and to raise more funds for the society.

Currently, CompSoc mugs cost £9.70 each to produce and are sold for £10, only a 30p profit per unit. The committee agreed to raise the price to £12 per mug going forward.

Wooden keyrings are currently sold for £1.50 each. It was agreed to increase these to £2. Acrylic keyrings which are currently £1.50 will be increased to £2.

It was also discussed to have more merchandise available for purchase at in-person events like the STMUs, balls, workshops, etc.

There was a suggestion to look into creating limited-edition or special themed merchandise to generate buzz and increase sales.

Finally, it was proposed to open an online web store for CompSoc merchandise, so people can purchase items and have them shipped out.

Meeting adjourned at 6:47pm.

> Meeting around the creation a new SIG for competitive programming

Present (9+2): Fergus (President), Elisa (Treasurer), Vincent (1st Year Rep), Cat (Tech Sec), Charlotte (Social Sec), Tomas (3rd Year Rep), Vojtech (Project Share), Ol (Tardis), Marton (Potential SIG Committee), Said (Potential SIG Committee), Chives (Old Person Rep), Aurora (School Rep)

# Socials

Charlotte: karaoke was kinda dead, guessing after HTB. Any other ideas for socials

Fergus: beer pong

Charlotte: is karaoke unattractive

Fergus: I woulda went, but I was too tired

Charlotte: I will do another beer pong event for the next weekend (16th March)

## STMUs

Fergus: Do not do them at Nucleus

Charlotte: we can do AT lecture theatre?

Fergus: we should open rooms, not lecture theatres

## HTB

Cat: Can we change caterer for next year?

Ali: I might ask for cafe

Charlotte: you can pay them (a deposit)

Cat: What I think is a good idea is to submit to devpost and get short-listed, then other people can see who won and what projects

Ali: people don't know how to use devpost. Some people submitted at 12:55 (5 minutes before)

Cat: it would be faster to submit to devpost and shortlist than walk around

Ali: people would say it's unfair

Cat: how is it more unfair than a demo? What I'm saying is, you'll get to see what we do

Ali: next year, we'd prefer not to have hackathons UK people

Ali: hackathons UK suggested sending judges across the building to each team's table for judging and was hard to cooperate with

# SIG Proposal

Fergus: Try to present what your SIG is, we will ask questions and make a vote

Said:

- Competitive programming - the main goal is a context, a few hours (depening on contest), many problems given and you need to find solutions using algs and data structures.
- Many competitions, but the main one is in Netherlands. There are contestants leading up to it, such as regional UK and Europe.
- Best performing teams in a University continue to next stage
- We want to create a SIG around that concept, and preparing people for competitions
- But also for preparing people for similar type questions, like interview questions. That's one way we can increase our target audience

Fergus: do you have registered members

Said: 10 sigantures

Fergus: only 10? did you stop at 10?

Said: yes

Fergus: 10 is bare-minimum

Said: UK competition has 40 people, so we can attract those people

Fergus: you are 1st years. Competitive programmers are usually scarce. What is the age demographic in terms of university year you have signed up
Said: so far, year 1s. But there are many people in competition

Fergus: if you only have year 1s, it might be hard to attract older students. How will you attract members who are better than you at competitive programming? Academic students can sometimes be stubborn to join societies, especially against progSoc?

Said: just to clarify, progSoc does nothing about comp programming

Fergus: they did last year

Said: programming club is not progSoc

Fergus: I meant programming club

Said: programming club people are focused on research and aren't really organized. I've contacted Neil and Michio, because we obviously need the school's support

Fergus: Michio might not be of much help

Said: I am mainly talking with Neil

Fergus: is programming soc the one that helps with the easier stuff?

Said: progSoc brings people together to work on projects

Fergus: the concern is then programming club, but it is not a problem since it is not a society. We do not want a repeat of the EUTIC issue.

Fergus: What are your plans for organization

Said: regular & weekly stuff: make a problem set and work on it together. For a more broad range, we can do workshops and do bigger contests. Eventually, we can do a inter-university competition (like pwnEd)

Tomas: (checking website) programming society is about intro to code

Fergus: my concern is that it's all first years, because you have not done algorithms course yet.

_Everyone gasps, jokingly_

Fergus: there is mathematical rigor in there. You will have people asking questions and detailed explanation. My concern is you don't have anyone yet, unless you are about to tell me you have the World Olympiad Champion

Said: I started this in HS, I feel like I'm quite well-versed in this. I was on the uni's winning team this year.

Fergus: That's good.

Ali: the competition is once a year. So your SIG will be active around that time?

Said: yes

Ali: will you do what SIGINT does like beginner and advanced workshops? Are you training to compete? Or is it "let's learn how to leetcode"?

Said: big competition is October, but there are many online ones, so we are planning to do many. Workshops are a good idea, but it depends on membership skill levels

Ali: do you need CompSoc funds and snack money

Said: most members are already in CompSoc, we will just need reach

Ali: are you planning to host events and speakers?

Fergus: I submitted funding proposal to Neil by estimating how much money each SIG needs for the year. If you have any plans for conferences, you will have to wait for a year for financing, or get your own money. CompSoc can help out, but we need to know ASAP

Said: we are not planning a big event in the first year. Depends on interest. Large events are future plans. We are looking for potential sponsors. There are big companies sponsoring competitions, like Jane Street (they sponsor Oxbridge).

_Fergus explains complicated financing scheme to do with sponsors and SIGs_

Aurora: how will you host workshops? I was at the competition, I don't see how you can do big group setting. Will you teach people leetcode?

Said: our regular meetings won't be a competition. We will have problems, people can work in groups or individually. Does not have to be a big group setting. People can be split into groups based on level and/or interests.

Ali: when do you plan to start?

Said: welcome week of next year.

Ali: can you prepare things in advance?

Said: we want to prepare everything, that's why we want to create SIG now so we know it's happening

Fergus: AI SIG had a freakout because the workload was unexpected. Can you guys set a standard and stick to it? Doing things weekly or biweekly is important, because otherwise you become a closed group. Maybe that's your goal, but then your focus needs to align with that.

Chives: we used to propose challenges, and whoever had an idea can present it

Said: we can do that

Chives: about the logistics, you need to sort out cooperation with the university, so that the team you propose actually goes to competitions

Said: there's a process in-place, not much we can do about that; it's up to the uni. We can just help people and teams prepare

## Vote

Passed unanimously.

# HTB

HTB applicants had to consent to the HTB privacy policy. Ali suggested creating a new privacy policy for HTB, Aurora suggested we use the University's existing privacy policy. Something that should definitely be formalized for next year is a protocol/policy for handling peoples data by SIGs, so the process is standardized across CompSoc.

Even though HTB should be a beginner-friendly competition, we evaluated candidates this year. Most people in the room agree that we shouldn't do first-come-first-serve (due to bots and quality of applicants), but we should focus on admitting more beginners. One way of doing this is making groups of applicants e.g., x number of expert hackers, y number of beginners.

Ideally, the voting pool should also be split and voted on by a diverse mix of organizers (this year, most applicants only received around 2-3 votes).

Maybe we should prioritize UoE students. Maybe we should make a quota for UoE students and non-uni students?

Another thing to consider is adding more people, but that means we need more money, which is why we will focus on getting more HTB sponsors for next year. Ali says maybe we can bump up to 300-400.

# PwnEd 5

Currently in debt (budget is ~20k), because we don't have as many sponsors as last year. We are cutting back on reimbursements for speakers.

The Nucleus building recently (a few weeks ago) started offering a grant (up to 500 pounds) for student-led events hosted at the King's buildings. The deadline for this has already closed for events hosted at the end of Semester 2, but this grant can be useful for events next academic year.

# Constitution Re-write

We should aim to finish the new constitution 2 weeks before the AGM, so the whole society can vote on it by then.

A new clause to be added:

- All society members can raise new constitutional amendments during EGMs.

> _CompSoc's committee and its Discord server moderators discuss the future moderation of the server._

Minutes by Vincent and Chives. Vincent's minutes:

### Attendees

Fergus (President), Ali (Vice-President), Krzystof (4th Year Rep), Yuto (Graphic Designer), Chives (Old Person Rep), Vincent (1st Year Rep), Ol (Tardis), Aurora (School Rep), Tomas (3rd Year Rep), Arin (2nd Year Rep), Maya (Secretary), Kit, Arch (HTB), Rokas, Paula, Aria

## Minutes

Each speaker has 30 seconds for opening statements. Fergus encourages everyone to propose solutions that will take into account the position of both parties.

### Opening statements

- Fergus
  - There are issues with unformalized constitution
  - A lot of procedures are passed down by word-of-mouth, not written
  - The goal is to have some solution that both parties would be happy with (and feel represented)
  - Fergus won't be in CompSoc committee for much longer, so he aims to help moderate this debate
- Krzystof
  - Agrees with Fergus on the matter; all decisions related to the society should be decided by the elected committee.
  - Acknowledges the Discord server is separate from the society, although that is strange.
- Tomas
  - CompSoc fills a very nice place in university life, and previous committees have done a big job shaping CompSoc into what it is today
  - A bit confused how CompSoc is different from the server
- Vincent
  - As first year rep, Vincent is quite new to the context of the society and Discord server.
  - Will to try vote on something that benefits both parties, as well as all CompSoc members.
- Chives
  - From what he's seen, the whole process looks unorganized and unformalized - old moderators stay with their roles, even if they aren't involved in the server.
  - Things should be formalized

**Arch, from Hack the Borough, walks in**

- Kit
  - Has been around in the society for a long time, but also acknowledges that people who have been around for long do not necessarily know better or the right way
- Rokas
  - Was on the committee a few years ago
  - Rokas thinks there is more good being done than harm with old committee members doing moderation
  - Rokas is happy to be removed from the moderation team, but wants to stand for those who want to stay
- Arch
  - "Thing is, I have no idea what this is about"
- Yuto
  - Doesn't participate in Discord moderation much
  - The impression Yuto made when he joined the university in 2020 is that the Discord server is very important for the society.
  - The fact that the moderation team is not directly related to CompSoc was strange, and the moderation team details should be formalized.
- Paula
  - Was on the committee long ago. Still has the role, but does not do any moderation.
  - Understands the need to ensure that those who stay with the role actually are involved in moderation.
  - The risk is that if a committee gets elected that doesn't have the society's best interests at heart, there should be a group of people who can advice the committee members
  - This problem should have formal documentation - most things are just word of mouth
- Aurora
  - "Agree with most of the committee"
  - Hopes for clarification why the moderation team is separate from the society
  - Understands that a large part of the debate is about protected channels, but feels neutral because Aurora is not a part of any of the protected communities
- Aria
  - Was on the committee 2-3 years ago, now in Tardis
  - Wants the server be more resistant to bad committee members if there is one in the future
  - Would like to have a say for graduates in the server, so graduates stay in CompSoc
- Ol
  - Wasn't part of the first meeting, wants to get a better picture of the problem before reaching a decision
- Ali
  - 30 people had a committee role in the past. Ali believes this role should be a minimum role, and not full of an excessive number of people
  - Questions whether a future committee that disagrees with the moderators or is "a bad committee" - would the moderation team be able to communicate with them or would it divide the server?
  - "If a future committee wants to take the server to a different direction, how will things go?"
- Maya
  - The impression being on the server is that a university space with 16-year-olds should not be moderated by older graduates.
  - Recognizes that there is a lot of moderation that needs to be done, agrees with Charlotte's proposals.
- Arin
  - Was confused by degree of separation by the server and the society
  - Agrees with Yuto - regardless of the solution, it needs to be formalized in the constitution
  - Believes the problem stems from the fact that we don't know what is going on

Sidenote: Fergus says we need an open meeting about constitution changes (with CompSoc members).

**Yuto leaves the meeting**

### Main discussion

Note to readers: the conversation below is not an exact quote, but a close account

- Fergus
  - The current model of the protected channels may not be as protected as we think
  - If malicious person X knows person Y, and is looking on dirt on person Y, they can join protected channels without writing messages, and monitor secret conversation (for example, person Y is closeted).
  - **Proposal**: protected channels are linked to the Discord server, and there are notifications when people join.
  - People who are moderators in CompSoc would be moderators in protected servers.
  - This would mean a future president (who sees all protected channels by default) would not be able to access these servers, because they would function separately from the CompSoc server.
- Tomas:
  - Agrees with the points in terms of security, but doesn't know how vetting works
- Fergus:
  - Vetting would be up to each protected server
- Aria:
  - Change the system that makes a bot send a message to the channel, so a new server is not needed
  - Change the moderation role permissions so presidents don't have access
- Fergus:
  - Even though it seems the server is separate from the society, there is an element that the server reflects on the society.
  - Fergus had a discussion with Neil about giving the school of informatics power to launch an impeachment of the president (this discussion followed the committee of last year). This also makes sense given that president is now a staff position.
  - We could decide on some number of positions (e.g., president, tech-sec and secretary) who have equal moderation roles.

Moving forward, the term "legacy" will include all Discord staff/moderators who are not current elected committee members.

- Fergus:
  - Legacy will be written into the constitution
  - Legacy + 2/3 majority can invoke an impeachment
  - Becuase this is written into the constitution, it's enforcable

\*Charlotte arrives, Vincent and Krzystof leaves. **The remaining minutes are written by Chives.\***

Fergus:

- The definition and who to be of “legacy committee” to be discussed in the future.

#### When should moderation permissions be removed from members?

- Ol:
  - Not doing any moderation does not necessarily mean moderation privilege should be taken away, e.g. people who has moderation privilege because they need to do server admin stuff
- Fergus:
  - This is to be decided case-by-case
  - Removing a moderator from the legacy team should be voted on by all members
  - Moderators should be active in the server. An inactive mod e.g., no posts in a month
  - Possible also to remove someone’s moderation privilege and give them back in a later time if they hope to return.
- Tomas:
  - Very old moderators should give background information
  - Is the society the server?
- KitB: (History of division of the server and society)
  - The IRC server was started a long time ago by members, and a few years ago society decided it to be the society's official server. Moderators decided to give society admin access. Committee taking over is a bit of a \[did not catch the word\] to members of the server who have been around for a long time.
- Fergus:
  - The server is the official server, though separate from society.
  - As CompSoc grows (with SIGs etc.), .. \[missed the end of the sentence\]
  - It isn’t something we want to go and make a separate server, it is important for the committee to have a say in what we do on the server. Server is not just a legacy members server, it’s a members’ server.
- Tomas:
  - Server becoming more CompSoc-y as time goes on. People didn’t know (anything happened before) assumes CompSoc equals the Discord server
- Fergus:
  - Maintaining a balance is important, and it can be achieved e.g. by legacy members being able to bring up impeachment.
  - (On how CompSoc is different from any other societies) CompSoc is run by a large number of people i.e. around 50. (Give examples of graduates involved in the Discord server, and interact with newer students) We want people to stick around (it’s very valuable), but also to look forward.
- Maya:
  - (On why possible changes are suggested) Something running as in the last 20 years doesn't mean it’s not broken, doesn't mean it never needs to change. Server not running by committee is strange, anything CompSoc branding is CompSoc.

**10 minute break**

#### Charlotte's plan

- Charlotte:

  - In old committee years some/all committee/president often had moderator roles, people think this was a bad idea.
  - Propose: to send out call for moderators (among all users on CompSoc Discord server)
  - If committee or moderators disagrees with someone within their group being moderator, they decide if the person should go. This can be a problem as each group decides within. The process needs to be formalised. Either committee and moderators can raise e.g. suggest to add moderators, both parties need to agree.

- Paula:
  - Constitution should state minimum members of moderators from committee/dedicated moderators
- Ali:
  - There should be levels of moderations

People agree maybe 2 levels of moderators, e.g. one does tasks e.g. removing spams, another does more including server admin

- Paula:
  - Consensus within and between committee and moderators(?)
- Fergus:
  - Suggests members vote(?)
- KitB:
  - Needs something fault tolerance, resistant from bad committee
- Fergus:
  - (Examples of possible effort to improve involvement on CompSoc decisions) To stream AGM/EGM, as many members (on Discord) does not come to STMU
- Paula:
  - Abusing mod power should be punished e.g. timeout. The idea needs to be formalised.
  - Two levels of mod should be good, e.g. one has power to remove spam, another to make more decisions.

_Paula leaves_

- Fergus:
  - About dealing with malicious committee: there is the impeachment procedure.
  - Agrees with Paula’s idea of having a punishment procedure.
  - If current students misconduct, the school has procedures.
  - For people who have graduated, the school (technically) can do something(?). On Discord, actions can be taken against the user e.g. timeout, which can be less of a concern compared to IRL.

Members vote: concerns about manipulation if not much restrictions on who can vote (everyone in the Discord server can vote), maybe some verification e.g. requires matriculation of other forms of membership. Moderators can be of a higher level of trust as they need to be approved by moderators (committee/non-committee) also with the impeachment process, the system should be robust.

- Fergus:
  - Protected channels should have separate moderators.

### Whiteboard

- Public mod application process
- Adding/removing mod process to be formalized
  - Voted within both committee mods \[Note on ambiguity from writer: Committee who are also mods or all elected committee members?\] and non-committee mod; both groups have to agree to proceed the change
- Clear consequences for misuse mod power
  - 3 strike system?
- 2 levels - how to promote & demote
- Separate system for protected channels

In Attendance: Fergus White (President), Ali Abdelaal (Vice President), Maya Copeland (Secretary), Charlotte Ausel (Social Secretary), Yuto Takano (Graphic Designer), Vincentas Danys (1st Year Rep), Tomas Maillo (3rd Year Rep) Kryzstof Grykiel (4th Year Rep), Jinxual Cui (Old Person Rep) and Ol Rushton (Tardis)

# EGM + STMU

Secretary may be voted upon in the EGM unless EUSA confirms it (edit: 18/01/24 - no longer open) and Treasurer. Maya is remaining EDI rep until February, and it will become a votable role. Liam O'Connor has not sent over a description for his talk yet, will need to be chased up. The pizza order will remain the same as the previous STMU.

# CompSoc SIG Fair

Charlotte needs to send an announcement about it. SIG reps are to meet inside the Security Lab or AT5.04, discussions of posters and leaflets as well of the use of screens took place. SIG Presidents can recruit new members and/or their successor. People will make an announcement inside inf1b lecture. Gary from the Informatics Makerspace wants to showcase the going-ons inside the makerspace.

# SIG Meetings

Rediscuss times - SIG Meeting 15:00 - 16:00 tends to be short and gap to committee meeting at 17:00 is large

## InfBall

Photographer invoice, can be reimbursed ASAP if necessary (say to Fergus) but otherwise submit form and wait

#  Constitutional Rewrites

Fergus suggests:

- SIG Formalisation
- Finance formalisation with relation to SIGs and in general
- Impeachment procedure with the school
- Definition of committee includes old roles, update it
- Define STMU and SIG as acronyms are never expanded
- List of active SIGs:
  - rebuttal, would be tired of many EGMs
  - SIGINT & Tardis making it clear
- Two different definition of a SIG proposed:
  - Currently, a "mini-society" within CompSoc that:
    - receives: money, doesn't have to deal with EUSA, general support, massive members from CompSoc
    - gives: CompSoc promotation & marketing, members back to CompSoc
  - Suggestion of having a funded SIG with return of promoting CompSoc, versus a non-funded "partner" SIG (for e.g. research labs or SIGINT)
  - Rebuttal:
    - Labs are not "open to everyone"
      - Trials are fine, e.g. sports societies and EUTIC do "trials"
    - Research labs don't need to EUSA anyway
      - But they may have external dealings that we can liase with anyway
  - Quorum:
    - 75% of those with voting power (incl. 2 execs), like 15 people
    - Suggestion: SIG Presidents count as votes, but not count to quorum
      - "whether we can hold a vote" - number of active core committee
      - "whether a person can vote" - SIG Presidents + Committee
      - Rebuttal:
        - Number of SIGs can grow, so SIG Presidents can band together and overpower committee
          - Core committee can leave room and cause quorum to fail
  - SIG Creation:
    - Voted in by "elected committee" (which = core committe?)
  - SIG Presidents:
    - Fully chosen by the SIG, but currently it has full committee power despite being fully
    - But SIGs have multiple presidents or no presidents, when any member can come for
    - Suggestion:
      - Using the suggested Quorum change, SIG Presidents are "optional" committees.
      - SIGs get a "seat" not a President role, and that "seat" can
        - CompSoc retains the power to remove the "seat" if necessary
      - What if they are also member of core committee:
        - Do they count to quorum, do they count votes??
        - or two roles in the core committee (should it remain be possible, should office bearers also be possible)
  - SIG Dissolution needs formalisation:
    - Procedure for dissolution needs to be documented
      - Can be itself suggest or CompSoc can disband
  - Social Secretary
    - Split role into Social Media / Marketing and Social Secretary
  - Levels of decisions will be neccessary (we really don't want quorum for deciding pizza numbers):
    - Suggestion:
      - Trivial decision, no quorum unless someone feels it is non-trivial, it is trivial
      - Simple majority vote: ?????
      - Simple non-pressure vote: ?????
      - Quorum vote: ?????
      - Build specific platform: if you have account then you can vote. We should _not_ have fully anonymous votes, votes should always be revealed after voting
      - Core committee can use abstaining and just be counted
         - Allows vote online too
        - Should cast vote before or during the event until the vote closes, allows applying the same rule for Discord/etc online votes
- Removal of "non-students need to pay 2x fee"

> _Discussion centered around the creation of AI SIG_

### Attendees

**Committee (9):** Fergus (President), Ali (Vice-President), Charlotte (Social Secretary) (present online), Adam (Tech Secretary), Aurora (School Rep), Vincent (1st Year Rep), Tomas (3nd Year Rep), Krzystof (4th Year Rep, GameDevSig President), Chaives (Old Person Rep)

# AI SIG

- EUSA is considering making an AI society outside of CompSoc.
- Fergus told EUSA that CompSoc is the AI society.
- There are 11 people listed with UUNs wanting to create AI SIG within CompSoc.

Before the committee voted on whether to create AI SIG, two present members from AI SIG answered questions in a Q&A.

## Q&A for AI SIG

Q: The founders of AI SIG are master's students, what will happen once they graduate?
A: We are collaborating with second & third year students, who will help run AI SIG in upcoming years.

**Q:** What kind of speakers do you have in mind?
**A:** Currently we plan to host a talk from an NLP researcher at Apple. Some people at AI SIG have experience with reaching out to speakers and contacts. We hope top companies will be willing to collaborate with AI SIG, because many top AI engineers come from Edinburgh.

**Q:** Do you have a plan to bring new members into the SIG? Will you only host speakers or also beginner workshops?
**A:** We hope to provide a place for beginners to develop their skills, but also a place older/master's students can share and find a space that is relevant to them. There are downsides to hosting long repetitive workshops, which is why we plan to first formalize the structure of AI workshops.

**Q:** Will AI SIG require members have background experience in AI? Will it be beginner friendly?
**A:** As master's students, it's nice to have more niche topics, but we are also planning to host events relevant to people with less experience with AI.

**Q:** How did you get the Apple contact?
**A:** We joined a tech discord server, and an apple NLP researcher reached out that they are keen to do a talk with us.

**Q:** The proposed AI society is not hosted by informatics students. If you are under CompSoc you will obviously be technical, but will you also focus on material catered to non-STEM students? Will there be non-technical talks, such as on AI ethics?
**A:** We are very interested in collaborating with the people behind AI safety hub (who focus on AI ethics and are less technical in background), and if AI SIG gains a lot of interest we plan to host talks with them.

**Q:** Will there be projects, or just talks?
**A:** It will be beneficial to know how many people will be interested in AI SIG. We can do workshops, meet-ups for competitions. We will ask members what they are interested in and what kind of events they would find appealing.

## Committee vote to create AI SIG

- Vote passed unanimously.

AI SIG does not have a president appointed yet.

# Hoppers

- Hoppers wants to partner with us for a CompSoc challenge later in the academic year.
- Fergus is happy to give Hoppers a challenge, including prizes.

## Meeting Minutes

- Financing
  - Sophie (Treasurer) stepping down due to fourth year studies taking priority
    - In role until January STMU (which will be an EGM), happy to continue InfBall organisation
  - Santander Bank Account: **frozen due to suspicious activity**
    - Can't invoice with the account until 12 January until situation is resolved
    - Fergus has confirmed via Neil that the School is happy to be invoiced until this point as an emergency measure
      - Pizza specifically can be ordered ordered through the university's ties with Papa Johns. May need to notify orders much earlier than a day before like we traditionally do.
    - Approx 700 GBP is in the EUSA account for emergency use too, although likely not necessary this time
  - Sponsor Companies
    - Currently approx 14.000 in locked Santander account (could be higher if Bloomberg money arrived before locking)
    - Meta requires student societies to be a legal body with a VAT number (cannot use EUSA's charity number), and complex situation
      - Sophie + Fergus are in the loop and working on this
      - **TODO**: Fergus to see if he can get Meta to deposit to School instead and transfer to CompSoc
    - Terra: pending replies on their side
    - Google: pending replies on their side
      - **TODO**: Fergus to ping update for this
    - Participation Grant of 5k:
      - Estimated results and arrival would be around February
- Important Person
  - Fergus having 1:1 with an important person announced tomorrow to talk about CompSoc
- College Representation
  - Aurora (School Rep) hasn't received replies on request for posting CompSoc on CSE newsletter or mailing list
    - **TODO**: Aurora to chase up on this
- Events
  - Socials and Bar events
    - **TODO**: Yuto to finish graphics this weekend
  - November STMU: Speakers ready, graphic pending, poster pending.
    - Budget: around 300-350 GBP
    - **TODO**: Yuto to finish them and get them up in AT before weekend
  - January STMU: Speakers pending, graphic pending.
    - Budget: around 350-400 GBP due to start-of-semester influx
  - HackTheBurgh:
    - Discussed in SIG Meeting at 15:00: potentially have SIGs set sub-challenges within a CompSoc challenge, offering top 1/2/3 prizes within the whole of CompSoc challenge
  - Infball
    - Ticket prices to be decided near time of sale, but estimate budget using 50 GBP (2022: 35 GBP, 2023: 55 GBP)
      - Reduce after-party tickets as it was packed last year - lower income. set higher prices?
    - Status: Currently scouting for venues (The Caves and Dynamic Earth are candidates due to Balmoral declining society bookings).
    - CompSoc has capacity to fund 5,000 GBP now if needed
      - By January/February, can offer a minimum of 2k extra or more as needed.
      - For now, estimate with roughly the same plan as last year (7k from CompSoc, 1k from School).
- Dicsord Server Moderation Debate
  - Yuto raises that moderation of CompSoc Discord feels detached from society
    - Fergus cites multiple past incidents where current committee has clashed on decisions with moderation team
    - Students assume moderation decisions come with committee input and we are targeted as a result
    - There is a possible chance that CompSoc IRL event attendance is affected by a perceived closed-friend-group chat feel
  - Input from experienced people still important for consideration
    - Possibly keep separate communication channel for advice
  - Decision on 'Committee Members will be the sole moderators of CompSoc Discord'
    1. Committee members can choose to add specific people to help either moderation or event organisation (Hackathons, InfBall, etc). These people will be removed a the end of each society year and re-added if continuing, to ensure all mods are active
    2. There should be a creation of a channel for asking for and receiving advice from past committee
    3. Because this would make the Discord Staff role obsolete, delete this role
    - 12 Committee members present and in agreement for
    - 1 Committee member absent and against
    - 8 Committee members absent and not voted

# 2023/11/08 SIG Meeting

> _This is the first occurence of fortnightly SIG meetings, separate from Committee meetings. The aim is to discuss issues that affect SIGs, individual SIG problems & event updates, and any updates with budgeting/funding._

Attendees:

- Committee (Fergus (pres.), Ali (vp.), Sophie (treasurer), Yuto (graphic des.))
- QuantSIG (Alex, Sachin)
- CloudSIG (Juin)
- Tardis Project (Aria)
- GameDevSig (Krzysztof)
- Project Share (Vojtech)
- TypeSig (Amy)
- SIGINT (Jacob in place of Lorian)

**Consolidated TODOs**:

- **SIGs** to request any additional funds apart from the base 300 (exceptions for TypeSig [500] and SIGINT [1500] for conferences) through Fergus (who will contact Neil)
- **SIGs** to put down email addresses in Discord #sigs to view funding spreadsheet that Sophie owns
- **SIGs** to draft up and send to Fergus (Discord/email) their target demographics, average attendee numbers, and what kind of things companies can get out of you
- **GameDevSig** to draft up an event idea by end of this week for a late-semester that Vincent can advertise in-class.
- **QuantSIG** to refresh posters and put them up for more visibility.
- **Fergus** to think about the AGM-style event ("Re-freshers event" in January) for SIG showcase. Potentially raise with Committee.
- **Fergus** to ask School about use of lockers for SIGs or alternatively making the cupboard more accessible out-of-hours.
- **Ali**/**Fergus** to sort out November and January STMU speakers, for which Tardis (Aria) is available to do a talk.
- **Yuto** to distribute CompSoc brand logos in color and monochrome.
- **Yuto** to draft up several mini-logo designs and placement on graphics, and optionally send out poll to SIGs if cannot decide.
- **Yuto** to create a SIG showcase poster and/or a graphic for the TV screen (likely 16:9).
- **Adam** or other interested members to overhaul website and include more things in SIG section, make meeting minutes more visible, update sponsor logos, potentially add event images.

---

## Funding

- **Problem**: Neil has brought up that it is too many SIGs for him to fund
  - **Solution**: Fergus will be meeting Neil weekly anyway. Fergus to formalise a "contract" thing for SIGs, so SIGs can request through Fergus and the School can get guarantees that it will be used for the requested SIG only
- CompSoc Funds:
  - Base funding for SIG doubled from 150 to 300 GBP
  - Exceptions for SIGINT (annual 1500) and TypeSig (500)
- Additional funds from the school (re: proposal above):
  - Contact Sophie with formalised request just like for society funds
    - Put down any hypothetical fund requests as definites as the paperwork requires this
- Sophie owns read-only spreadsheet of funds
  - **TODO**: SIGs to put down email addresses to view spreadsheet

## Commercialisation of CompSoc

- **Vision**: Selling CompSoc through the School of Informatics. Pursuade companies to purchase the sponsorship package for CompSoc & SIG.
- SIGs
  - **TODO**: SIGs to write target demographics
  - **TODO**: SIGs to write average attendee numbers
  - **TODO**: SIGs to write what kind of things companies can get out of you
- Timeframe
  - Anytime from next semester to next academic year
  - SIGs should prepare this academic year already -- making sure your SIG doesn't die (finding committee)

## AGM-style event for SIGs

- **Problem**: Many SIGs likely will have successor problems (bar TypeSig & Tardis who have an idea).
- **Proposed solution**: AGM-style event for SIGs. Students write manifestos, SIGs look over it.
- **Proposed solution**: Lots of SIGs this year (likely first time), so maybe a SIG Fair. "Re-freshers event".

## Meeting Rooms

- Payment now required for G.07.
  - TypeSig has had to pay 275 GBP (cheap for venue of that size, but still).
  - HTB & PwnEd likely will be able to pay up -- harder for smaller SIGs

## Branding

- **Problem**: CompSoc logo has to be on SIG graphics. However CompSoc logo color clashes (red vs blue on TypeSig). Logo size is also large and less legibile at small sizes

  - **Proposed solution**:
    - **TODO**: Yuto to distribute original logo and monochrome logo
    - **TOOD**: Yuto to propose several favicon / small logo / heart and get SIGs to poll
    - **TODO**: Yuto to formalise positions of logo on branding
    - Small logos/graphics should be for just general PR like insta/posters, but for conference posters or sponsorship decks, it should be full CompSoc logo.
      - This is to prevent situations like PwnEd last year where CompSoc logo was nowhere to be seen

- **Problem**: SIG visibility and gathering members
  - **Proposed Solution**: Poster for showcasing SIGs. Use TV in lower ground floor of AT.
  - **TODO**: Fergus to check how to get access to the TV.
  - **Problem**: Lots of SIG, likely crowded on a single poster or TV screen.
    - **Proposed solution**: Link to website or LinkTree.
  - **Problem**: Website SIG section is barebones and website in general is not very used
    - **Proposed solution**: Overhaul website
    - **TODO**: Adam (or other interested members) to rehaul website to make SIGs section contain brief sentences like "we run events every Sunday".
    - **TODO**: Adam (or other interested members) to increase visibility of meeting minutes
    - **TODO**: Adam to add company logos to sponsorship section
    - Maybe start adding event photos to the News section?

## SIG-specific points

### GameDevSig

- **Problem**: On the verge of death in terms of finding next committee next year & getting consistent attendees
  - **Solution**: Sell it more as a side hobby instead of a daunting game project (such as game jams like how SIGINT do weekend CTFs, connect with other SIGs/societies to launch collab events)
- RockStar Games confirmed for 7th of February
- **Problem**: Target audience slightly unclear - the interested people seem busy
  - **Solution**: Target first years
    - **TODO**: GameDevSig to draft an event proposal (single sentence & date) by 12 November & CompSoc will get Vincent to market during lectures
    - (Perhaps a Haskell GameJam to target first years after the FP competition)

### QuantSIG

- **Problem**: Event attendee decreasing: Second one only approx. 15-16 attendees.
- **Proposed solution**: Take down posters and re-design and set them up with different colours for eye-catch.
- No updates with EUTIC since last time.

### Project Share

- **Problem**: Can we get lockers in AT for Project Share & other SIGs?
- Status of those lockers unsure, cupboard could be a viable alternative
  - **TODO**: Fergus to get School involved to get proper cupboard

### Tardis Project

- Available to do a talk about Tardis infrastructure
- Likely January STMU

### CloudSIG

- First event with Guest speaker around 20 attendees
- Next one 29 November

## Socials

Some students from higher years feel it was difficult to join CompSoc in their first year. We are looking to do an event with Informatics Sport so as to include and welcome more of these students.

After a meeting with Charlotte, Pilgrim bar has agreed to partner with CompSoc. Pilgrim bar will offer us 20% discounts on non-promotional items (no discounts for specials, for example). To apply this discount, CompSoc attendees will need to have a special Pilgrim card. The committee will distribute these cards with details included in an announcement in the coming weeks. CompSoc social events at Pilgrim will probably run either Thursdays, Fridays or Saturdays. To avoid conflicts with events organized by SIGs or other societies, the committee will consider organizing events in partnership with SIGs or Informatics Sport, especially for events that book the entire bar.

## School workshops

CompSoc will email a network of schools inquiring for interest in computing workshops for high school students.

Workshops will likely run in the afternoon for ~2 hours and will include members from different SIGs. There are different workshop ideas for different age groups. For example: a microbit workshp for S1/S2 students, a coding workshop for S3/S4 students, introduction to Haskell to S5/S6 students. There might be scheduling challenges for workshops oriented towards older students due to exams. The committee will work with schools to ensure workshops are held at convenient times.

Workshops may also include mini-CTFs by SIGINT or game development workshops with GameDevSig. This needs to be discussed with SIG committees.

The current plan is to run pilot one-off workshops at schools. Later, CompSoc might organize recurring workshops if there is there interest for it.

## STMU and EGM Results

The EGM was a success for the most part. There were some problems in regards to manifestos given, as a result, in future, we are going to make things more clear that opinions given in speeches or manifestos are not related to CompSoc as an entity due to people feeling slightly uncomfortable. In future, when introducing the committee we would like to be more open and introduce ourselves with names and pronouns, the committee decided to softly ask speakers to include 'name and pronouns' but not enforce it for them as it could make them feel uncomfortable.

## Sponsorships

The University wants to help CompSoc with sponsorships by reaching out to companies on our behalf. As a result of this, we will need to figure out a new way to market ourselves and what we can offer as a society and across the SIGs to make us more appealing to the university in order for them to be willing to reach ou tto various companies on our behalf. We are hoping to offer various 'packages' for companies to sponsor SIGs individually as well as offer sponsorships for CompSoc + SIGs or simply CompSoc individually. The committee is unsure of how to do this and the best way forward.

## Minor SIG discussion

We are going to ask SIGs to bridge CompSoc's announcement discord channel to their own individual discords to help increase STMU and event turnout. We also want to raise more awareness of what SIGs are and how they are run as within the EGM there was some confusion on what SIGs are so we would like to provide more clarification in order to make things more open for new members, especially those from other schools with CSE.

## Constitution

We are hoping to rewrite the constitution as a result of the aforementioned issues, especially in regards to having the University help us out with funding in order to codify finances that are to be given to SIGs as this will be something that could come up with future committees.

## QuantSig/EUTIC conflict of interest

A note: if it seems like this section is long, it's because this discussion was most of the meeting, going from 17:00 to 17:30

### Elaboration of complaint/what happened before

Before: EUTIC contacted us to let us know they are not happy with QuantSig which they claim overlaps with their aims.

EUTIC people:

- Eren - Chair
- Marian - Vice

ETIC claim to have the same interests of QuantSig and have contacts at Optiver, have participated in quant events, etc.

From CompSoc, we didn't know (and in particular, Fergus didn't) know that EUTIC had a quant division.

From QuantSig specifically, they don't claim to have minimal overlap since EUTIC is usually for 1st/2nd years.

EUTIC's quant team has two aspects, beginner and more advanced groups.

- Beginner's quant team is for non-CS students, such as using Python in the context of finance (to model stock trends, for example).
- The advanced team does things like compete in the Optiver competition (3 to 5 teams), are made up of 100% CS students.

To join advanced team, the EUTIC requirement was more of a personal statement as to what your abilities are, and if you're skilled enough you can become part of said team (more to help develop their skills better; if they're not experienced in programming, say, they would be suited for the beginner's team).

QuantSig claim not to conflict with EUTIC's interest because there are no tutoring and the SIG is open for anyone to join. Although QuantSig is going to enter the same competition, they aren't that similar.

EUTIC weren't aware of QuantSig so find it more important to clear up what each other's roles/goals are.

**Something to discuss** the sort of channels of communications between the two groups. Such as, to go directly to QuantSig as opposed to going through CompSoc. QuantSig claim that the way that EUTIC are talking to them are rather hostile. The head of the advanced team was unresponsive, for example.

EUTIC claim that all of the issues come from miscommunication. They claim that QuantSig has banned Eren, and that QuantSig hasn't exactly been the either (although more claims have been made from both, I'm going to refrain from including details because of potential hearsay).

EUTIC and QuantSig are willing to move past this.

### What to do from now

EUTIC's open quant group, the beginner's team, is open-access, however, is designed for non-CS and even non-STEM people. They are also noting that QuantSig have the exact same format in their meeting as EUTIC has. They are happy to work together so long as these groups are less overlapping.

QuantSig are willing to do change the specifics of what they're doing to make it different from EUTIC. However, they do wish to have semester 1's activites be like how they are now (doing the Optiver challenge, even if this is very similar to EUTIC).

For this semester, the two groups cannot collaborate because of the rules of the challenge. QuantSig should point less finance experiences people to EUTIC and vice versa for people who are interested in CS (meaning, beyond the beginner group but not so much suited for the advanced group).

Fergus mentions that it's helpful to have QuantSig because there are a lot of CS students who are in the CompSoc sphere and who don't necessarily leave it to go to other societies; EUTIC can see promising people who are interested in finance who can support them better than we can.

A collaboration where QuantSig can be helped a lot by EUTIC is beneficial to both societies. Since EUTIC's semester ends in November, it would be useful to work after this (end of academic semester 1). EUTIC is holding a beginner's competition (workshop? thing?) for people to create a Python stock predictor where QuantSig can advertise to more CS oriented people.

From here, QuantSig (and Fergus) should attend EUTIC (committee) meetings and EUTIC (quant team leaders and the head of the society and whoever else relevant) can come to QuantSig meetings/CompSoc meetings should they be needed.

## Formalisation of SIG money

CompSoc has SIGs which are well-sized enough to get their own sponsors and, in general, their own pot of money.

Money from Neil (and by extension school of inf) will go to CompSoc rather than any other SIG. This will then go to each SIG depending on what the school/what CompSoc would like to fund. It does not make sense for SIGs to meet with Neil anymore.

We will create a contract which says, in essence, that X amount of money goes to P SIG, Y goes to Q SIG, etc. This will promise the finances to whoever is paying.

## Sponsorships

- Meta: want to do a workshop but haven't responded after being told that a sponsorship was a prerequisite.
- Microsoft Research: doesn't sponsor student groups as a principal.
- Other ones to look into: Rolls Royce, G research, Modlr (TypeSig says to talk to a certain contact, so this looks more likely).

UoE Experience Grant, ArcherySoc got the full 5k GBP, so this should be relatively simple.

## HTB updates

Applications are in. Sponsors to be discussed (contacts at school of finance and elsewhere), so things are progressing well.

## STMU

### Student memberships

Are inf students part of the society or not? Will be talked about with Neil when Fergus meets with him soon.

Constitution does not mention needing EUSA membership.

For this STMU we will probably do as we did each other year: those who are not a EUSA member, sign up on the day.

Idea: once a year, for example around EGM, each SIG meets independently to have an accurate member count. SIG members should also be EUSA members.

We may or may not want to formalise members on Discord to allow them to recognise they're a EUSA member.

Should promote becoming a EUSA member.

## Finances and SIG's funcding

We got our first sponsorship money, £7,000 - The bank account now has £16,500 in total. £730 belongs to SIGINT, CompSoc might not be able to give infball the usual £7,000. We also are wanting events such as InfBall to be more sustainable. Due to miscommunication last year, a lot of sponsors are unhappy and don't want to help us via sponsorships. Fergus has emailed multiple comanies such as Bloomberg. Money will be given eventually, hopefully, but due to issues last year we might struggle. We need to make sure to give back to these companies and not just take the money for granted. SIGs will now get at least £150.

## SIGs

CompSoc isn't happy about representation from SIGs, there's been many ideas discussed, but we're going to ask them to add our logos to posters. Announcements will be bridged. A lot of SIGs have dead general channels that are linked within CompSoc. Fergus wants to advertise on the student mailing list. We're still trying to maintain as much transparency as possible, and are asking about information about moderation actions across SIGs in-case of problems.

## STMU Planning

Announcement on Monday for first year reps. SIGs should come along and advertise themselves. We're planning on doing a talk, EGM, then another talk. We have it from 5:30 to 8:30. We might want to announce some events at the beginning when we're announcing the committee.

## Issues with ages in CompSoc

Having input from ex-committee members can be useful, but they can overstep their boundaries at times. People are getting annoyed about it, and think that the secret compsoc excommittee discord servers etc. can be annoying and too influential on ideas, and are wanting to rely less on ex-committee about it all, only really querying them for things like "what did the process for x used to be".

## Handling of moderation problems

There was a problem in the CompSoc book club -- things were handled fairly quickly, but Ammir had some problems with the way moderation is handled within CompSoc. The person in question had requested that it be brought to the committee. He has chosen to seperate book club from compsoc entirely, and to give up things with CompSoc (namely EDI Rep) and thinks that CompSoc deals with some long-running problems, as a result Maya is now EDI Rep until there is either a replacement or otherwise.

## Possible new SIGs

Fergus explained the process for new SIGs as well as the fact that there's a lot of SIGs that get created but do not end up being successful for multiple years due to not hosting events or not having enough members. SIG 1 - QuantSIG - Can easily get the 10 members discussed, they would plan on doing quantitative analysis focused on the intersection on finances and computer science, they were sponsored by Optiver, they want to always have an ongoing event, run a hackathon and regular society events, they'd consider running talks or workshops, a lot of their members are in Year 4. It passed with greater than two-thirds majority, the de-facto leader is Alex. SIG 2 - AWSSIG - They wanted to start something similar to the google programming club. It's in partnership with AWS with real training, they plan on running workshops and talks and many events. The name and being more aws-focused is a major point of contention amongst the committee. The vote passed with 2/3 majority on the condition that Amazon is ok with AWS, otherwise it'll be reconsidered, the president is Juin.

## Hack the Burgh

Harsh is running Hack the Burgh, we are letting them know that the committee is still needing picked, and if records were kept for running it this year. We're unsure if it will be run beginning of 2024-April 2024, Harsh and Hackathons UK will be helping out. Hackathons UK will be happy to help out with knowledge due to working with many hackathons across the UK so Harsh will be in good hands.

## Sponsors

In terms of sponsors, we only have one contract signed, but we are _really_ looking for more as we only have 7,000 guaranteed. Fergus will try and get in contact with as many people as possible if there's any contacts from peoples' internships. EUSA has 2 funds that might come in handy for finances, £500 for smaller things and £5000 for things that would benefit the wider community. We could maybe talk to people at the career fair. Things to look at in the future is how SIGs get sponsorships, especially because of us creating more and more SIGs.

- Optiver are yet to respond, particularly for HTB
- Google will respond in November.
- Goal is £15k which appears to be achievable.
- If any committee members have contacts from internships or other networking then share with Fergus.
-

## Todo

- Make articles on how to set up social events on CompSoc Committee Wiki
- Update spreadsheet with newer email addresses to help next president.
- Email AWSSIG and AlgoTradingSIG (see below).
- Hoppers, Cascaders: talk about it next meeting.
- Constitution amendments at EGM (see below).

### STMU

- Speakers ready (Wadler, Project Share).
- Venue booked from 18:00 until 20:30, technically booked from 17:30 but someone else has it booked until 17:30 but says that they will finish at 16:00.

### EGM

- Positions open:
  - first year rep,
  - old person rep,
  - NEW: establish advisory role. See other important changes below.
  - potential secretary opening up
- Increase members required for SIG up to 10 people, see the SIG section below for details.

## Welcome Week Events

In general, well-attented. Should do same quantity of events next year.

### Photo Scavenger Hunt

- Least attended.
- We should make it more related to computing things to stand out form other society's events.

## Todo

- Make articles on how to set up social events on CompSoc Committee Wiki
- Update spreadsheet with newer email addresses to help next president.
- Email AWSSIG and AlgoTradingSIG (see below).
- Hoppers, Cascaders: talk about it next meeting.
- Constitution amendments at EGM (see below).

## Sponsors

- Optiver are yet to respond, particularly for HTB
- Google will respond in November.
- Goal is £15k which appears to be achievable.
- If any committee members have contacts from internships or other networking then share with Fergus.

## Social stuff

- Look for partnership with Pilgrim Bar or Maki & Ramen (made from GameSoc).
- Make partnership with Pilgrim as opposed to Bar 50 in the future.
- Weekly low-effort event? Such as pub, movie, café night etc.
  - Two years ago café was tried but wasn't too popular, maybe combine with Project Share?

### STMU

- Speakers ready (Wadler, Project Share).
- Venue booked from 18:00 until 20:30, technically booked from 17:30 but someone else has it booked until 17:30 but says that they will finish at 16:00.

### EGM

- Positions open:
  - first year rep,
  - old person rep,
  - NEW: establish advisory role. See other important changes below.
- Increase members required for SIG up to 10 people, see the SIG section below for details.

## Graphics

- Sponsors need to be finalised before printing cards.

## Relationships with other societies

- Friendship with MathsSoc will be established more in the future.

## Other important changes

Ammir would like to help out with treasurer role, on-paper Sophie would stay as treasurer, and Ammir would 'advise'. Perhaps it could be called co-treasurer.

## HTB Planning

- Hackathons UK representative (Steph, Discord username `chari`), good friend of Charlotte, who has agreed to help.
- Definitely part of HTB team: Harsh (Discord username `undeadjoker`).
- Committee HTB member: Sophie
- Harsh should come to next committee meeting to decide how many to help out in the HTB team.
  - Also bring Aria because she organised it two years prior.

## SIGs

- Constitution:
  - Any SIG that wants to be set up needs 4 members (of CompSoc) and clearly defined goals.
  - The 'leader' (for some definition of 'leader') gets to sit with the committee meetings.
  - SIGs do get financial support but it isn't defined how much.
- We need to increase the required members from 4 up to 10.
- TypeSIG
  - Established. It's up to them to do whatever they wants because we can trust the members.
- AWSSIG and AlgoTradingSIG
  - AWSSIG doesn't have enough members. We also don't like them being called AWSSIG, better would be CloudSIG.
  - AlgoTradingSIG doesn't have enough members too.
- Sophie will ask SIGs (including Tardis) how much money they need in the \#sigs channels (in particular SIGINT).

## Cupboard

- Games consoles moved to GameSoc.
- Drawer (with membership cards, etc.) things were removed which were important and drawer disposed of (?).
- Other things to be discussed next time.

This meeting took place at 17:00 on the 19th of January, lead by
President Ben McConnoville.

## CompSoc events

Bar50 has offered to sponsor events, giving members cheaper drinks, will
require us to hold events in their pub, probably booking rooms and such.
We need to get back to them and let them know of our interest. There's a
hackathon going on, which we've tried to get a place to do it for
CompSoc members. We've been given the infball invitation and want to
invite members of staff, a maximum amount of 10, with people such as
Neil, Bjoern etc.

## HTB Updates

HTB has started posting social media updates, having a lot of
interactions by people from other universities. HTB has quotes from
providers, they need help setting up things and Jacob has been helping,
they need a step-by-step. Registration will be out Monday, they can hold
about 200 people. Compsoc have been asked for funding, we're waiting on
Sophie to give help with funding. Sainsburys bank is sponsoring the
event, giving £1500, theres a lot of sponsors showing interest. Barclays
is also interested, giving £6500. They're using Informatics Forum.

## STMU Plan

Since SIGINT is booking inf forum around the time we'd likely be hosting
a STMU, we may need to go elsewhere for the event. We don't have Optum
for the STMU, we have a speaker from the University, the talk is \"Web
games: the fast-food of video gaming\". We have a few sponsors wanting
to give talks too, which should give us the STMU time for the year.

## Upcoming Social Events

**Event 1:** STMU **Event 2:** Pub night

## Potential Events

- Sporting events in Semester 2.

- Browser/Editor Wars (Week beginning 7th November)

## Sponsors

ShowCode offered £500 for us to create a page on their site. More
information is needed and we are expected to get \>= 100 members to
register. Would be nice to help improve finances, but there is doubt
over how to get members to register. It's useful but possibly
unnecessary. Could be used in workshops. HTB has replied to all
sponsorship emails, need to add them to the GitHub team. Meta has
contacted us today about invoicing.

## Hack the Burgh

Contact between CompSoc and HTB has been less than stellar, with
messages not being replied to in the committee chat and emails not being
replied to, with sponsors being left to wait for considerable amounts of
time. They're looking for h a minimum of £5000

## STMU Feedback

We ordered way too much pizza, not the biggest issue but the waste is
bad. Add information on rough timescales of STMU attendance and timing.
Get pricing for all the pizza, cups and drinks.

## Banking update

All reimbursements have been made, access to the bank account has been
done. Bank transfer is recommended for future reimbursements. Ben and
Sophie are looking to speak to the morningside Santander.

## Sponsorship update

Waiting to hear back from Sainsbury's Bank, they're willing to sponsor
HTB. A meeting is being setup for sponsors contacted within the last
week. Edinburgh innovations are looking for help with advertising on
both ends, with us being able to use the innovations room.

## Meeting with SIGINT

Updated SIGINT on the changes being made within. They've been informed
that we have the bank account. Add a section in the form that will let
CompSoc know which SIG is being paid in/out and how much. We've asked
SIGINT to keep a note of how much has been paid in, just for simple
tracking reasons. CompSoc are streamlining the handover process, SIGINT
are hoping for less middleman-y things in the future. A wiki is being
setup, but the transparency is needed to increasing, having a wiki to
let future committees know what to do in the future, to improving
handovers. SIGINT are requesting CompSoc's help for a SIGINT conference
next semester, especially as it is planned to be much bigger than the
yearly PwnED event.

## Upcoming Social Events

## Hack The Burgh Updates

Contact has been made, and planning has begun. Meetings will be setup
and Lita will join later on. HTB Team has had their first meeting, and
are looking into room bookings. Finance team is looking to reach out to
sponsors for financing the event and prizes. Lita is possibly looking
into getting into a partnership with HTB. Will be updated in future.

## SIGINT Updates

Does SIGINT exist as a part of CompSoc or is it seen as an external
Society, especially as there is a lot of recent feelings within SIGINT
that CompSoc hasn't been helping out a lot with things such as finances,
and event support. More clarity is needed on what SIGINT can do within
CompSoc. There are things such as advertisement that are feeling
underwhelming, such as needing more help with advertising events,
getting finances easier. There are feelings of \"ignoring\" and \"not
being taken care of\" by SIGINT Ben whenever questions are put towards
CompSoc.

## Banking Updates

All documents have been sent off, and we're waiting to hear back from
Santander, the process has been long and annoying though. Hoping to have
it in time to change how the handover works for future committees to be
not run into the same issues. SIGINT are looking to possibly move to
their own bank account.

## Collaboration with Lita for future events

The entrepreneurship scheme within CompSoc will be a SIG. Lita will be a
staff sponsor for whenever CompSoc needs to talk to the University. Will
host a hackathon and then announce a EntrepreneurshipSIG election. It is
supposed to inspire creativity and entrepreneurship as classes such as
SDP aren't working as they are easily forgotten.

## Upcoming Social Events

**Event 2:** November STMU on the 30th. Give out the last of old
CompSoc merch at STMU. Dylan and Accenture are doing talks at the STMU. Information has been given now \
**Event 3:** CompSoc Christmas Market. Planning for CompSoc to meetup
and travel around this year's Christmas Market.

## Following up on Last Meeting's Minutes

Going over HackTheBurgh, Ben was supposed to have a meeting today but
she didn't turn up, hoping to hear back soon. October 25th STMU,
expenses were £130 for food, £15 for soft drinks, Secretary handover has
been complete. Prepare November 13th STMU Talk \[name tbd.\]. Normal
person for STMU isn't there but maybe find someone else who is already
contracted with the university. Successful Halloween, get expenses. Pub
quiz, should start next few weeks, can just go to Teviot afterwards as
we're not expecting many people to stick around. We're looking to get
Nerf guns for an event. Meeting with GResearch planned, get new CompSoc
flags. Begin research some more hoodie designs.

## Update on Sponsors

Meeting with Sainsbury's banks, Google, GResearch and Blackrock. These
are for hack the burgh, speaking to Lita from informatics over multiple
ways to sponsor CompSoc, through Edinburgh Innovations. Running
different hackathons and giving money to the winner to fund different
projects, to work more closely with CompSoc, she is offering us the Bay
Centre or Inf Forum, bringing Edinburgh Innovations to a CompSoc SIG.
Maybe push the health tech society to be a SIG, but they are looking for
us to help run a hackathon. Sponsorship money has been fulfilled, around
the same amount as the previous President.

## Banking Updates

Getting Alex to call Santander to update details, trying to get the
process sped up.

## Secret Santa

Use the website always used for Secret Santa to plan out gifts and gift
giving.

## EUSA Bookings

EUSA Bookings aren't happy at us not using them for any events, as the
main venue has always been available.

## Upcoming Social Events

**Event 1:** CompSoc watching the fireworks show at Calton Hill on the
5th. Meeting at 7:30 at AT or 8:00 ontop of Calton Hill. Everyone will
go to Teviot after.

**Event 2:** November STMU on the 30th. Give out the last of old
CompSoc merch at STMU. Dylan and Accenture are doing talks at the STMU.
Information unknown currently.\
**Event 3:** CompSoc Christmas Market. Planning for CompSoc to meetup
and travel around this year's Christmas Market.

**Present:** Artemis Livingstone, Alexandra Purcarea, Ben McConville, Mikey Andrejczuk, Callum Leask, Ammir Barakat, himmelmaus

**Agenda**

- Update from Alexandra on Hoppers and other events.
- Discussion on recent racist memes and imagery in informatics servers.

**Discussion and Decisions**

- **TODO for year reps:** Advertise the STMU.
- We will have committee members show the way to the TechCube room, as well as print a sign.
- Arty mentioned the possibility of a (paid) liaison position with the School of Informatics in the future. This can be delegated to an executive committee member (president most likely), maybe in the constitution?
- **TODO for Yuto:** Start the migration to GitHub pages/DigitalOcean as soon as possible.
- There have been some recent racist memes shared in the inf2 server, which have not been acted on appropriately by some committee members. Jane Hillston is aware of this situation, but no investigation has been launched. This is a very difficult topic that will not be expressed properly in these minutes. Ammir has concrete proposals as to how to commit to anti-racism as a society, including donations to foundations (some of which were promised last year), including the future SoI EDI representative in meetings, and actively participating in EDI efforts (including STMUs and EDI training for members). We might also want to consider an anonymous report form.
- **Impact, not intent.** This also extends to jokes about Romanians.
- **TODO for Karthik:** Please show up to meetings! As an executive member you are expected to come every week.
- **TODO for next meeting:** Talk to Bence r.e. memes being shared in the inf2 server.

- **TODO for Alexandra:** block bookings for the dining room at Teviot.
- **TODO for Arty:** Talk to Kami r.e. security talk in the November STMU.

- Intending to hold Ball in-person at Balmoral (deposit carried over to 2022 - tentatively booked 16th April 2022)

- Contract with Balmoral CCed on Social Sec email - Kim to find most recent contracts and forward to committee

**Present:** Alexandra Purcarea, Samuel Macleod, Yuto Takano, Andi Dicu, Ammir Barakat, Patrick Kage, Jorge Sanz (SIGINT), Michael Andrejczuk, Artemis Livingstone, Karthik Narayanan, Paula Sparrow

**Agenda**

- Checking in on handover, in particular email accounts, how to make sense of all the emails we get etc.
- EUSA annual report
- Arty mentioned something about BCS
- Tardis donation pitch
- Discord mental health channel discussion + bots that might be needed (this might entail some voting)

**Discussion and Decisions**

- SIGINT update: everything is going well, other than BCS, which is taking a while to pay and in the meantime, people are waiting for prizes. We decided to float them the money to buy prizes.
- **TODO for Anabel:** pay SIGINT 1,800 GBP (contact Jorge Sanz).
- If people to get control of their emails back, they should share a password rather than ask Yuto to transfer the email account again.
- Tardis is in need of money in order to upgrade their services. Although not a SIG, many of our members are invested in this project, and it is older than CompSoc. There was a discussion of whether we should help them through reimbursements. We would probably prioritize Tardis over a charity donation. Moreover, we could set up a way of receiving money in their name.
- **QUESTION:** Should we allocate (a fenced amount of) 3,000 GBP to be used by Tardis on a case-by-case basis throughout the year? Voted **in favor** unanimously.
- Mental Health Channel: Discussion over including said channel as it might be innactive or might be too dark. Was suggested to have access on a role operated channel. Suggestion for it to become a venting channel so as to avoid dark themes, and it should be closely supervised. Instead of channel a workshop was suggested as well as having a professional come in to give a talk.
- **CONSENSUS** Against having a mental health channel as it has a potential to spiral into dark themes. Mental health resources will be provided by Ammir and pinned to #serious/#announcements. There was talk of a mental health workshop and talk for next year.
45:T607,---

**Agenda**

- Discussing the last STMU and what to do next
- Talking about the Heriot Watt joint social (plus a summary on the call with them)
- Making a workflow for promoting events that includes several social media platforms
- Flatmate finding proposal for freshers
- Coming up with a CompSoc HTB challenge
- SIGINT update
- HTB update

**Discussion and Decisions**

- The STMUs are generally going well, though viewership isn't ideal.
- We need to post the events several times before they happen, as well as look for different outlets.
- The workflow will be a pinned message on Slack, written by **Alexandra and Tudor**. It will include Google Calendar, Facebook, Discord and the possibility of emailing members/Neil as well.
- **Alexandra** will start a document for the next committee on advice and responsibilities.
- HTB meeting should be happening soon.
- SIGINT might need around 1K in case there are not enough sponsors for their CTF, PwnEd. That money would be mostly spent on prizes and would match last year's spending. The majority of people voted **in favor** of helping them out financially. 5 out of 8 people voted **in favor** of paying the entire sum if SIGINT does not get another sponsor.
- The flatmate finding scheme would be done either way, but CompSoc can get involved. We want to organize a social event for people to find flatmates by themselves. Neil is likely to help us with such an initiative.
- Committee people should try and join the HTB stream throughout the hackathon.

**Agenda**

- Pronoun roles on Discord
- AcFam Family Feud
- STMU
- G-Research coding challenge

**Discussion and Decisions**

- G-Research event moved to 2020-12-03 because not many people signed up for the event, but it is limited to students in their final two years only.
- STMU by Transfer Wise: no response from company, so if still no communication by Friday then Ananya will speak about biotech as a student speaker. Allie is okay to postpone event to next Friday, and Tudor to make FB event and add to Google calendar.
- Family Feud: could make a league, form to find out family availabilities, to be done by Ananya
- Christmas events:
  - Due to lockdown, lots of freshers haven't been able to form strong friendships/groups and will be stuck alone in Edinburgh on Christmas day so we could set up Discord on the day to give people a space to drop in
  - Cook-along - Alex: there is a society that has a weekly bake-along, could be done a few days before Christmas
  - Christmas movie watch-along: could do joint with Glasgow CompSoc, and create poll to decide which movies to watch. Maybe collaboratively with another society if appropriate depending on movie?
  - Committee secret santa -> Ananya, reddit matching
  - Recruit volunteers to provide food/entertainment for children throughout Edinburgh during festive period
  - Presents to those in Edinburgh? E.g. postcards/socks
- Pronoun roles: no opposition, Artemis is on it

  - We need to define a clear protocol
  - There is now a 'quarantine channel' to talk to individuals in question and understand what's happening, conversations in this channel will be one-to-one so as not to 'gang up' on the quarantined
  - This also provides a paper trail
- We are still paying for the old minecraft server

**Agenda**

- Welcome new committee members
- Donations
- Upcoming events

**Discussion and Decisions**

- New members:
  - New treasurer = Anabel Yong
  - New 1st year rep = Artemis Livingstone
  - Encouraged to read constitution and familiarise with SIG structure.
- Discord needs to be promoted further as it is now being used as primary mode of communication -> put it on the website homepage.
- It is getting difficult to keep track of events => better coordination on the Google calendar is required, and adequate descriptions must be added with event details.
- Calendar Later was discussed? Blocker: Kyle
- RSS feed for calendar to Discord hasn't worked so far, but if it can be made to work the committee is happy to adopt this.
- Secretary: needs to get instagram and twitter accounts back up and running.
- Feedback survey: to be posted (social sec)
- AcFam Adoption Night was a success - attendees are keep for regular events of similar formats
- Budget surplus inciting donation conversation:
  - Particular causes we are keen to support include, but are not limited to, computer science promotion and support in primary schools.
  - Links for suggested causes were supplied, to be added.
  - To decide on who to donate to, a curated poll (similar to that used when Turing Trust was selected) could be used to also engage members
  - President has made a Slack thread for committee members to post suggestions of causes in one place
  - We could get involved with CodeDojo in more than a purely monetary capacity
  - Discussion RE: lump sum donation amount still pending
  - All outstanding debts as of this date are currently settled
  - Pay received from Optiver and G-Research
  - For lump sum donation: suggestion of multiple smaller installments, possibly to different recipients, was suggested and supported. This can then be spaced out to accommodate upcoming costs/financial uncertainty
- Secretary: news on website needs to be updated

**Present**
Alexandra Purcarea, Ryan Schuller, Elspeth Smith, Patrick Kage (SIGWeb), Rob Phi (Guest), Samuel Macleod, Daniel Kirkman, Ananya Majumdar

**Discussion and Decisions**

- Voting platform - Rob Phi:
  - Democrat is an online, live platform
  - We are being granted a free trial of sorts, which when paid for includes branding and pay per credit costs.
  - Numbers are only shown in admin portal
  - We will be using the simple majority mode
  - Uses Kubernetes?
- Production costs: approximately £200-250 per event, but this is roughly half of what would be spent on pizza for IRL events => worth the investment.
- Donations: worth looking at, there is enough money to warrant the discussion.
  - Considerations to keep in mind include anticipating costs, hit of recession post-COVID, etc.
  - The committee as a whole agrees to not take political actions as that does not fall within the remit of CompSoc
  - Charity suggestion - Black Curriculum
  - General ideas for donating:
    - Merchandise store
    - Talks in collaboration with other societies (eg ISOC)
    - Lump sum
    - Panel discussions - pre-recorded to maintain hygiene, Q&A style.
  - Unanimous vote in favour of donation of some sort.

  - Thought Machine talk on building software quickly and at scale.
  - Allie has asked that the candidates submit recordings of their speeches to ease transitions

  - From discussions with Optiver - particularly a Robert who leads a Masters course - they have offered the SIG access to OptiBook (a trading training platform?) under conditional circumstances they are willing to discuss.
  - Lecture confirmed for 2020-10-29 on market making.
  - Follow up call planned for 2020-10-30 to discuss access to Robert's course and so on.
  - SIG are keen to contact G-Research as well.
- ScotQuan: the committee is not able to run the SIG in the absence of its own committee, therefore we will make enquiries if there are any who would be interested in taking over but otherwise the SIG will become defunct.
- Meeting time: doodle poll posted on Slack.
- Collaboration with WiSTEM: the proposed collaboration is a series of workshops around social issues such as unconscious bias, imposter syndrome, gender identity, etc. The committee is fully in favour of this collaboration.

**Present:**
Alexandra Purcarea, Elspeth Smith, Yannik Nelson, Daniel Kirkman, Ryan Schuller, Rokas Gudavicius, Tudor Finaru, Alessia Ciocanea (guest)

**Agenda**

- Discussing a potential algorithmic trading SIG
- Editing the sponsorship PDF
- Discussing details for the academic pals program
- Making a final decision on donations

**Decisions**

- Alessia introduced her potential SIG, touching on aspects such as the events that they plan to organise, and the kind of relationship that they would wish to have with CompSoc. She was also keen to learn how CompSoc runs - specifically SIG wise. It would seem like their idea of a trading-related SIG would be quite in line with what we would expect from a SIG, but further discussion is clearly required on many topics. Everyone agreed that we should meet their other team members, too.
- Elspeth asked our opinion on signing up for accountancy software – everyone agreed.
- Ryan confirmed we can now edit the Sponsorship PDF. Alexandra and Ryan will handle the editing: fonts, new pictures etc. We should aim to send it to potential sponsors by late July.

**TODO**

- Have another meeting with more members to discuss:
  - Donation response
  - HackJunction event
  - Potential SIG
- For Alexandra and Ryan: finish up sponsorship doc by late July

**Agenda**

- How to respond to and support the BLM movement

**Decisions**

- Writing a post was unanimously considered the bare minimum to do, though the details will be further discussed in the chat. The general guidelines for it is to be non-inflammatory and tech-related to some extent.
- The general consensus was for us not to get politically involved, though what counts as ‘political’ is subject to debate. Palantir and BAE are possible counterexamples to the non-political rule. Antiracism is not political, but the BLM movement might be seen as political.
- Drawing the line and defining our involvement in socio-political issues might be useful, and could be done formally through the constitution. Other committees might have different ideas, but it is good for the current one to stay consistent.
- Defining political involvement might ‘shoot us in the foot’ later, as it might encourage us to stay complacent. On the other hand, some guidance on these issues was considered better than no guidance at all, at least as a starting reference for future committees.

- Monetary decisions must be unanimous and will be further discussed at another meeting in the near future.
- Some people objected to donating on the basis of not putting a price on people’s lives and rights, as well as not knowing charities that well. If we do decide on a charity, we need to track where the money goes, preferably towards educational purposes.
- We want the community to have a say on who we donate to, and that might be done through the open poll system. There were concerns whether that would only draw attention to us and not the cause.
- The amount to be donated was greatly debated, starting from 300 GBP up to even 2,000 GBP.

- Supporting the movement should be continued through this year, possibly through debate-style events to give people a platform, and through reinforcing our equality and inclusion rules. On the other hand, we have to be prepared to be held accountable for anything said during these events, which defeats our rule of not being politically involved.

**Votes**

- _Should we specifically include the words “black lives matter”?_ - passed unanimously
- _Should we include the petition to Peter Mathieson in the post?_ - passed unanimously
- _Should we post as soon as we can, not waiting for the donation post?_ - passed unanimously

**TODO**

- Have another meeting soon discussing:
  - Whether we’ll actually donate
  - How to decide who to donate to
  - What charity/charities to donate to, and whether they’re strictly tech-related
  - How much to donate
  - Whether we should match donations and set a threshold for them
  - Research charities before the meeting
- Make sure we can include Elspeth in the conversation next time

**Agenda**

- Handover conclusion
- Organizing social events
- Sponsorship

**Decisions**

- Handover is finalized.
- Fresh Air Radio is going to use our GSuite in order to create a few email addresses; at no cost for us.
- In order to raise awareness of the society, we should host a Q&A event for freshers, along with SIGs.
- Ideas for other events could be online pub quizzes, video games nights, webinars, and workshops (technical + soft skills).
- The academic pals plan is more relevant than ever, and we need to make sure we can match applicants properly.
- We might still want to do room booking.

**TODO**

- We are going to have another meeting to decide on our sponsorship plan, but we need more execs (old and new) to show up!
- Prepare for exclusively online events at the moment - make sure we apply early to the uni freshers' week app!
- Begin planning social events and contacting staff/speakers/other societies.

**Agenda**

- HTB
  - Went very well
  - HackerEats did not go so well. Might be a good idea still, but should be implemented better.
  - Use Hackathon.uk and MLH next year, helped with a lot of things. Helped with judging etc.
  - Judging needs to be planned better.
  - CompSoc challenge was fun, should be continued.
  - More things like the planking challenge.
  - Lots of help from the school, especially with the occupation.
  - We should be more transparent, perhaps invite a rep from the School to some central meetings.

**Agenda**

- Discussion of how the committee is run, and how the Slack should be moderated.
- SigInt Finances.
  - Payment from sponsors has been slow. They are likely sponsoring PWNed next year so payment will likely come through soon.
  - SIGint want to use some of the leftover money on hardware to do security research. They will keep the sponsorship money.
  - SIGint will still have the founder's feast. CompSoc will subsidize this.

  - Ticketing system has been made. Should be tested so tickets can be sold soon. Details should be finalized soon.
- HTB.
  - Due to the occupation the AT booking has been cancelled. For a lot of reasons having the event there is not good. May be legal, sponsor and personal issues. May make attendants uncomfortable.
  - More people can be fit in the IF, so we will likely fit anyone who would have been in AT.
  - The occupiers have agreed to retreat to the upper floors. However this is too big of a risk, as it depends on personal whims of the occupiers.
  - Sponsor swag has arrived and shopping has been done.
  - CompSoc challenge has been decided.
  - Still some details about risk assessment and banners/ merch to sort out.
  - The organizers for next year have to be selected.
- Strikes.
  - The occupiers wanted us to publish that we "negotiated" with them.
- AGM
  - Will be lecture shout out for new committee members. Deadline is by Friday 4pm 6th March 2020.
- CreateED
  - The event has been downsized by a lot.
  - CompSoc were initially "open to sponsoring", however this doesn't mean we are definitely sponsoring.

  - Venue: AT confirmed, still no reply about Gordon Aikman.
  - Planning to accept 230 people, with a split between AT and IF, with workshops in the LTs.

  - This is a subsidiary of BAE systems.
  - There was a student who emailed in with some issues with this sponsor, and took it up with EUSA. Might turn into a protest.
  - Negative press might affect CompSoc.
  - The event will probably go forwards without BAE, but will be a lot worse.
  - Might avoid BAE as a sponsor in the following years.
  - Might be sanctions from EUSA.
  - There has been a suggestion to move the event to be co-hosted by the Inf department, so it's technically not a EUSA associated event.
- Event with EEE.
- Hash code
  - Hosting with Hoppers, will split pizza cost with us.
  - Need to talk about the specifics of cost splitting.
- Sponsors need to be talked more about, both when they are considered and when they are signed on.

- The commercial law society is trying to merge many law society into one. Might be issues with this and LawTech.

**TODO**

- Clarify contracts and how CompSoc sponsorships and HtB sponsorships interact.

Kyle Cotton, Lars Thalian Morstad, Dee Yeum, Lorenzo Baldini, Ryan Schuller, Tony Duggan, Gwion ap Rheinallt, Lauren Graham, Rokas Gudavicius, Ryan Schuller, Alan Paul, Athiya Deviyani

**Agenda**:

- Meeting with Neil
  - Very productive meeting.
  - Promoting CompSoc on the uni screens. Very doable.
  - CompSoc should try to capitalize on DDI. Edinburgh is becoming the "data capital" in Europe and so CompSoc should try and run data science focused events. The uni is pushing for at least one for-credit data science course in most degrees. This coincides well with adopting scotquan as a sig.
  - There is a possibility that CompSoc and Hoppers can be put in a special position when it comes to events, as in that they specifially are allowed to book certain spaces. This remains to be seen as it's a decision from the school.
- HTB
  - IF booking policy has changes due to a lot of event request and security concerns. There are a lot of risks associated with the event, and there is a lot that can go wrong.
  - The university is tightening the security policy.
  - There is a possibility that the school could help book another space/ put funding into booking another event. We need to get more details about how much this could be, so we can rule out venues that are too expensive.
  - EICC is very expensive, up to £5k per day.
- InfBall
  - Neil and the school are very happy with INFball. There was a suggestion that some of the INF staff should be invited and get free tickets.
  - The school could help fund infball, however the details need to be worked out.
  - Balmoral is booked for the 4th of April.
- Merch
  - CompSoc can get very reasonable prices on hoodies etc through the school suppliers. They can also set up en e-pay page we can use. This solves the peoblem of having to set up our own web shop.
- LawTech
  - Going well, pretty good turnout on events.
  - Want to reach out to law school
  - Get more people active

**TODO**

- Get scotQuan constitution source.
- Joint events with infpals in semester 2
- Chase up SIGcoin
- Ask Neil about what the school can do about venues, and get more specifics of funding infball.
- Flat crawl

**Present**:
Kyle Cotton, Lars Thalian Morstad, Dee Yeum, Lorenzo Baldini, Samuel Macleod, Alexandra Purcarea, Elspeth Smith, Ryan Schuller, Tony Duggan, Alan Paul.

**Agenda**:

- ScotQuan
  - Received bylaw from ScotQuan demanded that CompSoc and ScotQuan be independent. The executive committee members had several issues with this.
  - A meeting with ScotQuan has been set up on Monday, where the executive committee will suggest a counter-proposal.
  - A formal definition of a SIG should probably be added to the constitution.
- HTB
  - Major issue with finding responsible people, however we might have a final responsible person.
  - The school has doubts whether the IF should even be used for these type of events, and suggest a plan B.
  - New gold sponsor, so increased budget.
  - Other suggested locations are the EICC, and DHT.
- Suggested Constitution change
  - There is trouble with having 2/3 of the committee show up to meetings.
  - The suggested change is to have the quorum committee defined as having 2/3 of the elected committee members, instead of all committee members. All committee members retain their votes.
  - Where we are required to have a 2/3 majority in votes, the vote would need a 2/3 majority of the elected committee and a simple majority of all members present.
- SIGs
  - SIGs shouldn't be able to disassociate, perhaps with the exception of the SIG submitting a written request to the committee.
  - Add cases where CompSoc can take control of a SIG.

**Agenda**:

- Minutes need to be reviewed quickly.
- SIGQuant
  - Some concerns, suggested that they run trial events too see how it goes. Should change name if they become a SIG.

  - Needs another meeting.
- ScotQuan
  - Fine with dropping payments, want to keep name. Very little expenses.
- HTB
  - Nothing much new.
  - Lost 1 responsible person but gained 1.
  - Sponsorship is going well, many companies interested or ready to pay.
- INFball
  - Venues are expensive, will probably be The Balmoral.
- Potential hackathons to sponsor
  - CreateED hack (EARS)

  - Compsoc will be donating a sizeable amount of money to Turing trust from membership fees, merch etc.
  - There was also agreed to donate an amount of the money left over from HTB as well. However this was not mentioned in the HTB, money sheets etc. Needs to be pinned down by the 23rd.
  - One idea is donating a smaller amount and use the rest for the next HTB.
  - Another is donating a larger amount(500-1000 Pounds). The stance is that HTB is entitled to more money.

- Finally, asking people from CompSoc to help out with HTB.
  - Patrick wants to continue what he did last year, with help form Kyle.

The first meeting during the 2017-18 academic year.

**Present**

Qais Patankar, Elena Lapė, Ginte Petrulionyte, Harry Reeder, Viktorija Lukosiute, Joshua Green, Nicholas Lynch

**Events**

We discussed potential locations and plans for our future events, and dates for PreHack and LocalHackDay.

**Community**

Engaging more with the community by doing regular Tuesday socials, and ensuring that we make pubs part of the STMU format.

Possibility of doing day-after-pub-crawl hungover nachos. Collaboration with other societies for social events. Making sure events carefully align to coursework deadlines, including coursework specific events.

A big secret event is being planned.

We have a blog where we can post a log our newsletters, do postmortems of events, and can submit great photos (+ an email address to share these). We can also share hackathon achievements.

Year reps need more responsibility, and could host coursework nights in AT (compulsory for courses with over 80 of the year enrolled, otherwise at their discretion).

Outreach outside Informatics as being achieved via similar schools, and a family system is something we’ll be working on next semester for the following year.

**SIGs**

We acknowledged that SIGs are a big part of CompSoc, and that they often need a guaranteed future. Inclusion into the constitution is planned, and a voting plan for SIGs needs to be included too.

JP Morgan is interested in running a Cyber Security event, something we can pass through SIGINT.

A networking SIG “SIGNet” was requested by Cameron Sharp:

- Some committee found the name confusing, and thought it was similar to SIGINT. netSIG was a suggested alternative.
- For a networking SIG, the committee voted: 8 for, 0 against, 0 abstain (pass)

Books: we have books, what do we do with them?

**General**

We have a bar sponsorship, and can issue their e-cards. We also have a planned field trip to Glasgow, with a potential visit to JP Morgan’s offices.

Hoodies are hopefully happening this time, with a potential for SIG logos to be included. Stickers are to also happen.

The first official meeting held for the 2017-18 committee.

**Present**

Qais Patankar, Elena Lapinskaitė, Joe, Cameron Sharp, Harry Reeder, Craig Snowden, Angus Shaw

**General Agenda**

- Making the “CompSoc Members” Facebook group public

  - Currently a closed group - no tagging/interaction with those outside the group
  - Fast joining - multiple admins approve new additions quickly
  - Public group means anyone can post which will give greater exposure
  - It’s already easy to join and post, there is very little screening except turning down obviously fake accounts
  - Closed is easier to protect privacy of post-event photos
  - Voted all in favour of keeping the group closed
  - Issue closed

- Events for older students

  - Most events and advertising geared towards first and second years
  - Contact other groups and ask for ideas - EdIntelligence, for example

- Sponsorship decks

  - Need a new one to replace the one from 2016-2017
  - Possibility of more informally contacting non-tech companies - e.g. La Favorita or other pizza companies and requesting discounts in exchange for displaying their logos
  - Probably best saved for a specific meeting

- Block Bookings

  - We won’t need to use this as we don’t plan regular use of EUSA venues

- [SlyRC](https://github.com/hreeder/slyrc)

  - TechSec working on it - crossover between IRC and Slack

- Ambiguities in the constitution

  - Constitution is open to all
  - Anyone can request changes on Github
  - We can address these at the EGM in September/October where the 1st year rep is elected

- CompSoc merchandise
  - Hoodies/t-shirts?
    - Expensive
    - Especially since most people don’t even pay for membership
    - Possibly give tshirts out for free with membership (good draw for signing up at freshers week stall)
  - Committee hoodies/tshirts
    - General “Committee” printings on hoodies
    - Useful for events, especially fresher’s week
  - New Flag
    - Asked previous committee how the old flag was obtained
  - Framing old flag
    - Or just the logo if we cut it out
    - Where would we put it?
    - Framed in Appleton Tower
  - Stickers
    - Good to have at the start of the year
  - New logo
    - Bring back old logos?
    - ‘100 Years of Turing/Geek Pride’ a possibility (but updated)
    - Cat with sunglasses logo (doesn’t really embody CompSoc though)
    - Possibly bringing back Appleton Tower AT-AT given we’ll be moving back there
  - Card
    - Updated with new logo
    - Possibly bringing back Appleton Tower AT-AT given we’ll be moving back theree
    - Possibly upgrading design of card, although this can get expensive

**Fresher's Week**

- Scavenger Hunt

  - First (and last) one done in 2015
  - Good daytime event for meeting people
  - Requires only minimal preparation

- Pub crawl

  - Tradition, easy to organise
  - Probably no need to contact pubs in advance to let them know of our coming

- Night of Games

  - Will need a fair amount of equipment
  - We have some older equipment (e.g. Xbox 360) already
  - Individual members needed to bring most of the equipment
  - Possibly request some equipment from members
  - Vice-President met with Neil Heatley and asked him about booking Appleton Tower, will probably be okay but dependent on the contractor - unlikely possibility of it not being ready
  - Old photos at tbrb.imgur.com
  - Collaboration with GameSoc - their secretary has asked us to contact her

- Activities Fair
  - Need a few people to informally hang around the stall
  - Have membership cards ready for the day - allow cards
  - Have (cheap) tshirts ready, with printing, if possible
  - Possibly give tshirts out for free with membership (good draw for freshers)

**Potential Future Events**

- CompSoc Trip(s)

  - Poll was done back in January - winners were Centre for Computing History (Cambridge) & Natural History/Science Museum (London)
  - Would be easier and cheaper to go somewhere closer to home e.g. Glasgow Science Museum
  - Should it be open to freshers and advertised in fresher’s week, or planned/signups taken now from existing members and then done earlier in the year?
  - Would be good to get help of SocialSec or any related SIGs
  - TripSig suggested by Joe

- Laserquest

  - Has been done before, through Eventbrite
  - Low quality equipment is to be expected

- Bowling

  - Last time, RSVPs were taken in advance but not many of them showed up
  - Money was taken on the day/afterwards

- BBQ

  - Is legal in meadows (although encouraged to use designated spots)
  - Having people bring their own food is the best plan

- PreHack 2017

  - Needs its own meeting - this is the biggest item on the event list

- Other hackathons

  - Last year we went to StudentHack V and StacsHack, amongst others. These have varying levels of organisation.

- InfBall & Christmas Dinner
  - SocialSec is working on this currently
  - Good to merge these into one event, given we have little experience with them previously

**Community submitted issues**

- Financial reports

  - Financial report isn’t comprehensive - many sponsors and assets are missing
  - We need a bank statement-style spreadsheet of all money in and out
  - We can also use GitHub project to keep track of money due and owed

- Concerns about ethics of big name corporate sponsors
  - Currently we have a mix of grassroots and big names
  - We need sponsorship from Amazon, Bloomberg etc, they provide much of our funding
  - We can’t afford to let them go, but will try to have local companies too

    - Evening of Games
    - Easier in Appleton Tower. Forrest Hill has just classrooms, Appleton Tower has open areas.
    - Plenty of walls to project to

- How to draw in non-Informatics students
  - Everything is advertised publicly yet there is little engagement with non-Informatics students
  - Posters - perhaps useful
  - Potentially using entire Informatics mailing list for some emails - careful not to spam too much though
- CompSoc Facebook presence
  - Should the group be made public?
    - Make the group modded/have each post need admin approval? Will this discourage discussion?
  - Different uses of page and group (some are more professional, others more communal)
  - Making CompSoc Offers more visible: shoutouts (STMUs), put at the bottom of newsletter

**General Agenda**

- 68 people coming from the Netherlands
- AGM is on the 15th March, event is going up tomorrow
- End of year party is on the 4th April
  - SDP is over on the 8th of April
- Annual report is in progress
- Hack the Burgh is going okay
- Committee handover bowling sesh
- Picnic in a few weeks time
- And a picnic a few weeks after freshers week
- Games night
  - requires a lot of hardware
  - Stored safely overnight, and actually stay at the event
  - Threat of hardware getting damaged or lost

**Future of CompSoc**

- Being a member of CompSoc, what benefits do you get?
- How many events are paid?
- There’s no sense of community
- STMUs: pizza, and sponsors present themselves, as well as other talks
- We have a group split
  - Drinkers and non-drinkers
  - We need to cater for both, but appear to just cater for non drinkers
- MathSoc
  - has a lot of socials, most go to drinking, some go to talks
  - Liaise with them to not clash events
  - Has “sub-committees”, board has managers for “socials”, etc.
  - Social manager has their own team that handles small stuff
- Constitutional change
  - for SIGs?
  - You must be in the same year as the year rep you are running for.
- HackSec should be appointed, not elected.
  - We can't have a complete newbie running things, Hack the Burgh is a valuable asset.
  - It requires dedication, we can't have people dropping out.
- STMUs are Vice President events, not SocialSec’s
- Freshers: are very keen, and need to be shown the ropes
- The circle is shrinking, we need to improve the community
- We need to be closer with Informatics, School of Maths shows up to MathSoc events
- Emails
  - we can get them sent to all the informatics, but we don’t want to spam. NH is okay with this.
  - School of Maths has weekly newsletters, which include “MathSoc is doing…”
  - Informatics has weekly blog emails, if we can get them to change it to a weekly newsletter, containing the blog update, compsoc, and general events
- As a tech society, we don’t have a lot of tech
  - Designated projects people can work on as a society
  - WebSIG needs to be expanded and have their own projects
