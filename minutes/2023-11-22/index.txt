</li>
<li>Dicsord Server Moderation Debate
<ul>
<li>Yuto raises that moderation of CompSoc Discord feels detached from society
<ul>
<li>Fergus cites multiple past incidents where current committee has clashed on decisions with moderation team</li>
<li>Students assume moderation decisions come with committee input and we are targeted as a result</li>
<li>There is a possible chance that CompSoc IRL event attendance is affected by a perceived closed-friend-group chat feel</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Input from experienced people still important for consideration
<ul>
<li>Possibly keep separate communication channel for advice</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Decision on 'Committee Members will be the sole moderators of CompSoc Discord'
<ol>
<li>Committee members can choose to add specific people to help either moderation or event organisation (Hackathons, InfBall, etc). These people will be removed a the end of each society year and re-added if continuing, to ensure all mods are active</li>
<li>There should be a creation of a channel for asking for and receiving advice from past committee</li>
<li>Because this would make the Discord Staff role obsolete, delete this role</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>12 Committee members present and in agreement for</li>
<li>1 Committee member absent and against</li>
<li>8 Committee members absent and not voted</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
