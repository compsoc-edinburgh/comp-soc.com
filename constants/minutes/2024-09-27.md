## 1. **HackTheBurgh**

- Futures Institute idea for venue so Godfrey will email and ask them.
  - It has a higher capacity than the Nucleus so could expand HTB to more people.
  - It is also a very new and nice venue so would be interesting.
- Should still ask the Nucleus as a backup option since its free.
- Conference idea for HTB on a day before the hackathon was discussed.
  - Ideas to get in speakers and do workshops.
  - This way we don't have many things on during the hackathon so people can focus.
  - Should talk to previous SIGINT president about issues running PwnEd.
  - Issues with the potential cost of adding an extra day to the event.
- Discussion on travel reimnursements.
  - There was an idea to discontinue travel reimbursements.
  - Although we can get the most applications if we keep these.
  - Idea to increase friction to getting reimnursements (emailing) so only people who need them will email.

## 2. **Academic Families Debrief**

- Feedback from the event was very postitive.
  - Fiona and the cohorts were very impressed and happy.
  - Roughly 100 attendees each night.
  - Some people wanted the games to be longer.
  - The time restriction made things more difficult since the event started late.
  - There was plenty of pizza for the event.
- The event that was planned for November was moved to January/February due to budget issues.
- There were people asking to switch families
- There were also families with only 1 parent
- Therefore we will create a procedure to move people to families that only have 1 parent.
- We should send out feedback surveys soon.
- Idea to consider making a committee for AcFams but after a few months.
- Anastasia to make a forecast for AcFams spending based on budget of 5k.

- Raffle was effective fundraising.
- The poster boards were bad an ineffective.
