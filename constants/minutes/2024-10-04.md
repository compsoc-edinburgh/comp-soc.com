## 1. **Good Things**

- Qube Gold Sponsorship!
- AISIG event (~ 110 people)!
- Project Share event (~30 people)!

## 2. **Social Media Structuring & Event Promotion**

- Lots of platforms to promote events and potentially too many announcements at a time / in once place
- Need to agree on times to post things and where certain announcements go (Discord, Instagram, Newsletter)
- Better communication with Agam/Lewis when planning an event
- Potentially have discord channel with event details for Agam/Lewis to work on posting (similar to announcement queue)
- Weekly newsletter worked well last year
- Using easily extendable templates will help to cut time for Agam/Lewis
- Have a spreadsheet with a cut-off date for submission
- Aim to finalise this process by Sunday (13.10.24)

- Potentially create a "promotion" team (not in committee)
- Hold interviews with potential candidates

## 3. **EGM**

- Need to announce by next Wednesday (09.10.24)
- Announce on discord, Instagram
- Promote the EGM to first-years through tutors in the committee
- Vincent announces to INF1A students with a slide in lecture

## 4. **Committee Chat / Roles**

- Lots of "Legacy Committee" users (~30) who have admin positions and can delete channels
- "Legacy Committee" users have gotten / will be upset if their roles are removed
- Propose to remove "Legacy Committee" members roles and the role itself and ask active "Legacy Committee" members if they want to keep their roles
- Having a committee discord will allow for multiple channels, without clogging the CompSoc one

## 5. **Careers Channel**

- Propose to create a new server / more channels for careers
- Companies want their events to be promoted over others

## 6. **AC Fams**

- Send an email to parents / children about event ideas, changing families, where to get help
- Set a week for each family to hold an event
- Encourage people to have special family traits (colours, traditions)
- Have a bingo with events to decide on an event each semester
- If there is enough budget (unlikely) we can hold a large AC fams event in semester 1. Otherwise we can hold it semester 2

## 7. **Committee Social**
