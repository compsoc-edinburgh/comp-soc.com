## 2. **AGM Promotion Update**

## 3. **Handover**

- We should all write wiki entries for our roles.
- We should have one-to-one handovers, explaining the role and important information.
- We can let the new committee plan a social and help when they are confused or stuck.
- Anastasia will create a document for running socials.
- There will also be space for other committee to fill in relevant information.
- This doc will be given to new committee to help run their first social.

## 4. **Discord Nitro**

- Suppporting server boosts (assuming no-one boosts anymore) would cost more than what we spend on SIGs. Not financially viable.
- We could consider rewarding those who boost the server with merch.
- Ideas will be discussed further if Discord members are interested and when more committee are present.
- Charlotte will talk to discord members.
