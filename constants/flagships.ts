      'Nearing the end of each year, we host an informatics ball where students come together and celebrate. When you buy a ticket it comes with a three course meal, beautiful atmosphere, drinks, music, great company, and a guaranteed good time! If you don’t want to splurge on a full ticket you can just buy a cheap after party ticket where we rent out a room in a club. All years of studies are welcome but there is priority for 4th years, who receive access to tickets before everyone else. Tickets sell out fast so make sure to get them as soon as they are available!',
