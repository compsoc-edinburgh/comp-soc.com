## Election Details

Our AGM is happening on April 2nd, at 18:00 in **G.07** of the Informatics Forum.

If you want to vote in the AGM, you need to **[make sure you have CompSoc membership](/join)**.

We also allow people to run on the night, if you did not have time to create manifestos.

_The views expressed on the following manifestos are the candidates' own and do not represent those of CompSoc. They are hosted here for the purposes of facilitating EUSA elections._
