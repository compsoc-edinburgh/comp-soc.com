# EGM details
Our EGM is happening on October 29th, at 18:00 in **G.07** of the Informatics Forum.

If you want to vote in the EGM, you need to **[make sure you have CompSoc membership](https://www.eusa.ed.ac.uk/activities/view/compsoc)**.

We also allow people to run on the night, if you did not have time to create manifestos.

You'll also need to prepare a stricly 1-minute speech.

We hope you think carefully about who you choose to elect tonight â€” please vote based on manifestos and speeches! Note that you may also vote for RON (reopen nominations) for all positions.

See you there!
Compsoc <3 You!
