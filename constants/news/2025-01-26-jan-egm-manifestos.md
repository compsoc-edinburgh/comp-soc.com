## Election Details

Our EGM/STMU is happening on January 29th, at 18:00 in **G.07** of the Informatics Forum.

If you want to vote in the EGM, you need to **[make sure you have CompSoc membership](https://www.eusa.ed.ac.uk/activities/view/compsoc)**.

We also allow people to run on the night, if you did not have time to create manifestos.

_The views expressed on the following manifestos are the candidates' own and do not represent those of CompSoc. They are hosted here for the purposes of facilitating EUSA elections._

| Role               | Name                                  | Manifesto Link |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| **Third Year Rep** | Nobody has run for this position yet! |                |

We hope you think carefully about who you choose to elect tonight â€” please vote based on manifestos and speeches! Note that you may also vote for RON (reopen nominations) for all positions. You also need EUSA CompSoc membership.

Election candidates - please remember that your speech should be 1 minute at a maximum. If you haven't gotten membership yet, **do that now**!

See you on Wednesday,

CompSoc <3 You!
